Additionally, we designed Instacash to help you access smaller amounts of cash in a pinch, such as for an unexpected late fee or a can't-miss date night and we designed it to be easy to payback! It isn't meant to be a way to fund your larger expenses. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in maximum increments of $50. Tips are absolutely optional and do not impact eligibility or availability, however, we encourage you to support the community and we highly appreciate it! You see, it takes a big team here at MoneyLion to keep 0% APR Instacash running smoothly 24/7. It's one of the most popular perks of membership! And your tips are what help us cover the high costs of administering Instacash at 0% APR for the large and growing MoneyLion community. We're happy to know that our products and other services are able to provide assistance and help you with securing that financial stability! We do appreciate your feedback so that we may continue to improve our products and services. It’s members like you that help makes MoneyLion ROAR!
