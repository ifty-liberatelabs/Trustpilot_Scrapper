        "text": "If you have two sources of income or receive disability benefits (both, in my case)  - then you are out of luck. For context, following a traumatic brain injury, I began receiving short-term disability benefits in addition to my job income. I was only medically cleared to work reduced hours and slowly work back up to 40 hrs/week, so the supplemental income was needed. \n\nTo preface, MoneyLion was initially my preferred app among similar cash advance apps that I tried. I signed up for a Roar Money account, ordered a debit card, and even took out a Credit Builder loan. Unfortunately, I am now stuck paying off a loan and paying a monthly membership fee for an app that I can’t use anymore.\n\nDespite what the website states regarding \"qualifying income deposits,\" MoneyLion does not actually recognize payroll-related/disability benefits as regular sources of income. #1) The app doesn’t recognize it as income, and users cannot change it. #2) When I reached out about this issue in the app, multiple customer service reps eventually informed me that disability benefits are not recognized as income. \n\nI still didn’t believe it, so I reached out again the following day. I asked them to confirm that disability benefits are not recognized as income. After a long wait, I was told that the issues were actually due to the fact that MoneyLion doesn’t support two sources of income - even if they both meet the “qualifying income requirements” outlined on the website, and even if they both contribute equally to monthly income. It confuses their algorithm - they cannot override it. My overall experience with customer service is a different story for a different day. \n\nPLEASE, if you fall into one of the categories mentioned above, save yourself some time and energy. Use a different app that better supports you. ",

Hey Moneylion, \"we're not slow.\" Moneylion is not helpful and their agents just tell a different story rather a different lie when you call. Their customer service lack there is horrible if ablI had them for years until recently. A Moneylion agent basically said they have no intention to fix their app problems so don't try to get their credit builder loan because you'll get a strange message saying (it's not you it's the internet timed out). I started seeing tho message years ago when i applied for their credit builder loan telling me (it's not you it's the internet timed out). I thought i had read it wrong but when i looked again i seen the same message. I told an agent at Moneylion years ago about it the message like other customers told them too but i see years later Moneylion is still up to their games. Customers also told Moneylion years ago about not being able to delete their address or bank account neither. If Moneylion won't fix their app from now on i suggest customers stop giving Moneylion a tip when you get Instacash. Let them earn their tips. Moneylion have so much stuff popping out on their app it's no wonder none of their short term fixes wotk. Now that it's a real problem with the app after their short term fixes didn't work Moneylion can't fix the problem they created but i see they still blames customers but never themselves. How sad Moneylion.",

It's a vicious cycle and was going very well until the last 4 months or so I am having login issues every payday so it is so frustrating my bills have become late along with my rent because almost my whole check goes into this account to pay back and borrow again which was working very well until my login problems started for no reason.

A couple times it took a whole week to access the website when I can get someone on the phone to help me, that can help I am so far behind on my rent now because of this issue it is getting out of hand because I need to have access all the time and not have these issues.

        "text": "If you’re in a bind MoneyLion is a life saver! I enjoy using the app, it recommends loans, credit building, investing and help with savings. My only con would be with instacash withdrawls and fees. When I first started using the app I was able to request instacash advances over $100 all in one order. Now you have to make multiple requests and the fees can become burdensome! While MoneyLion is good if you’re short on cash and need a few extra dollars until payday, the fees can add up with every withdrawal you make leading to an even bigger bind. ",

They won't give me my money I'm disabled on social security disability I pay all my bills when I'm paid so I check my account every day and seen that they didn't pay 2 of my credit cards and they froze my account when i had a AUTOPAY bank loan payment try to go through. So 2 credit cards and my loan all went into default and must be paid in full now totalling over $2000.00 it's been 12 days now and I'm getting charged daily on these , my credit I've been working on for over a year was finally up to 640 now it's down to 501 and keeps going down. Because of what ? I don't know I've read they do this to thousands of people and you can't sue them ,new banking rules thx to yours truly BIDEN have really fkkd up people's banking it seems they can take your account all the money in it, ruin your life and you can't do anything about it. So where's all my money ? $286. And $261 in payments to my creditors that they never received and the money in account is gone for them???? So I'll be going to jail or prison for this B.S.  why they can't be touched?!?? That's fkkd up and my death will be because of what they did to me I'm a senior citizen and disabled permanently , and poor I only get $1300 a month to live on and they robbed me blind, because I'm disabled I'm sure. So stay away if you're poor and vulnerable MONEYLION will rob you too! Especially disabled people they want that check for themselves and close ur account right after you're payed and steal it from you . I'm today in debt to others from this BS  $2860.00 ",
