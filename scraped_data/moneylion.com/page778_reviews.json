No. Because they closed my account for their new roar whatever accounts. Well way to mess over everyone who used your accounts for their taxes! I’ll stick to a real bank that doesn’t up and close peoples accounts. In a time where we all need our stimulus’s and income. Oh man and don’t get me started on like a year ago when I kept getting declines on my card and they had a message that they were aware and the whole system was down while I was trying to pay my rent. Sorry excuse of a bank.\n\nI can keep on adding to it. What about when you closed our accounts and told us not to worry we’d still be able to access our bank statements? Wrong, no bank statements anywhere. So now I’ll have to figure out another way to get my income and expenses to file my taxes! Everything about moneylion is disgusting. Left me stranded, no stimulus, closed my account, didn’t allow me to pay rent, or purchase my car, and took away my bank statements. Don’t call them but send them a message through chat. 🤦🏽‍♀️ It gets no worse.",
