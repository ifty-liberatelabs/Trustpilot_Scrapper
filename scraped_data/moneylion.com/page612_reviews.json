        "text": "If i could give moneylion a zero or less, I'd give it a negative 5. There's absolutely no customer service just a call center rep that reads prompts and tey and get a supervisor is another joke all in its own. CB loans are advertised as .05% apr or even 0% but that is a negavtive youre charged more for the loan plus in order to get a loan you only receive 10%of until its paid off then have to wait an additional two weeks to even be released to you, you also have to pay for a 19.99$ membership fee for services you already receive if you set up direct deposit. Oh and dont het me started with their false advertisement of getting paid two days early what a joke. And the instacash you do not geyvup to 250$ just because of direct deposit thats a membership fee as well to get the 250$ although you have your direct deposit set up with them. If you have any irregualr deposits made to your account like a friend transferring you money that will make their incapable and unreliable system lose any type of deposit information its ever received from you and its like basically starting iver to recieve instacash again. Its an elementary bank with no customer service or even an IT department to help correct with the incorrect deposits the system lables them as. Ive had nothing but trouble with this bank and the getting paid two days early was only valid for the first two months i started banking with them ever since i have not gotten paid two days early and its been seven months now. Im now just waiting on my direct deposit transfer back to chime because they actually honor what they advertise. Wish i would've never switched.",

I called back a few days later and was told a dispute was never created.\n\nI’ve also tried checking into hotels on 2 separate occasions and had my card declined both times because the charge was more than ITV was supposed to be. On both occasions, MoneyLion representatives have told me it was the merchant holding the extra money. Each time the merchant showed me exactly what they were charging, and in one instance they even spoke with the MoneyLion representative themselves and were told the same thing.\n\nI finally filled a BBB complaint, and the response given by the business was that they do, in fact, hold an extra 20% on charges like hotels and restaurants. Had I been accurately informed the first time this happened I could have planned for it the second time around.\n\nThis also happened once in a drivethru when I was paying for food, and I had no idea why it was being declined at the time because there was enough in the account to cover my order, but apparently not their extra 20%.",

This is to account for gratuity, and incidentals at these locations, and should disappear within a few business days after the transaction settles. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused. We are always looking for\nways to better our service, and your feedback is an invaluable part of that process. ",
