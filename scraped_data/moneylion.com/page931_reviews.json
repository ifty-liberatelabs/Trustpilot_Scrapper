If you're allowed to borrow $300 then you should be able to take it all at once. They say its free but it ends up costing a lot.\n\nEDITED:\nI understand the fees and yes its free. I also have no problem tiping either. Im not sure you understand what I'm saying. If i borrow $300 then I have to pay $3.99 six times then leave a $2-10 tip six times also being you guys only let customers take $50 at a time up to $300. I'm just saying it was nice the old way where you could take as much as you needed up to $300 in ONE transaction not SIX transactions. Its basically a minimum of $36 in tips and fees since you set it up this way. Technically you can say its free but really its not. More like false advertising. Just thought you would want some feed back from a customer to better your services.",

Additionally, we designed Instacash to help you access smaller amounts of cash in a pinch, such as for an unexpected late fee or a can't-miss date night and we designed it to be easy to payback! It isn't meant to be a way to fund your larger expenses. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in maximum increments of $50. We offer turbo delivery options for a small fee of $3.99 (to receive it instantly on your RoarMoney account or $4.99 for instant delivery on your external checking account or debit card. As an alternative, we also offer free delivery options to your RoarMoney account (receive your Instacash funds in 24-48 hours at no additional cost) or to an external bank account (receive your Instacash funds in 3-5 business days at no additional cost.). Tips are absolutely optional and do not impact eligibility or availability, however, we encourage you to support the community and we highly appreciate it! You see, it takes a big team here at MoneyLion to keep 0% APR Instacash running smoothly 24/7. It's one of the most popular perks of membership! And your tips are what help us cover the high costs of administering Instacash at 0% APR for the large and growing MoneyLion community. We're happy to know that our products and other services are able to provide assistance and help you with securing that financial stability!
