        "text": "I'm really enjoying my Moneylion account, currently using their Roarmoney checking and investing with direct deposit. The insta cash service is really convenient, no hidden fees or anything, just have an income. It has helped me out when money gets tight. Flexible payback time. I use the credit builder loan service as well, which has already jumped my score 17 points in less then a month. Pretty awesome. As long as you repay your payments , show income, your good to go. Higher income, higher instacash access $50 at a time. The only thing that is frustrating is connecting your moneylion account to another bank or service. Bank verification online using Plaid will not work, Metabank or Moneylion is not included.",
