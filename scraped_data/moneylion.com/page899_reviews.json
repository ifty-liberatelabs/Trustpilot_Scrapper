Just be sure to read the screens and make your selections carefully, and you can use Instacash without tips or fees if you choose. That said, if you choose to leave a tip — thank you! It helps us cover the costs of providing 0% APR cash advance to many, many folks like you! Also, Instacash funding is FREE if you choose standard delivery, which takes only 24-48 hours. If you need your Instacash extra fast, you can choose instant Turbo funding for $4.99 (or $3.99 if you have our RoarMoney bank account). The Turbo fee is totally optional and just helps us cover the cost of delivering your cash advance instantly when you’re in a pinch.We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly.
