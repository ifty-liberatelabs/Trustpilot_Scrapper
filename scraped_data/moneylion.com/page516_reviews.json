Therefore, demonstrating consistent direct deposits and on-time payments can increase your Instacash eligibility, while a negative change in these factors could lower your Instacash eligibility. \n\nTipping is optional, and whether you choose to tip doesn’t affect your eligibility in any way. Pay what you think is fair, or don't pay at all, it's up to you. Just be sure to read the screens and make your selections carefully, and you can use Instacash without tips or fees if you choose. That said, if you choose to leave a tip — thank you! It helps us cover the costs of providing 0% APR cash Instacash advances to many, many folks like you!\n\nInstacash funding is FREE if you choose standard delivery, which takes only 24-48 hours. If you need your Instacash extra fast, you can choose instant Turbo funding for $4.99 (or $3.99 if you have our RoarMoney bank account). The Turbo fee is totally optional and just helps us cover the cost of delivering your cash advance instantly when you’re in a pinch.

They told me to send them a bunch of documents and an explanation of some transactions to reopen the account but gave me inoperable links to send the stuff to. When I told them about the problem with the links suddenly nobody is available and the conversation is over. Difficult to communicate with, won't give you information about your acct. They have caused me quite a headache and several problems to deal with. Do not give them your money!",
