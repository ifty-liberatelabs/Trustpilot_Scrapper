So I couldn’t receive a Roar Money debit card when they switched from the money lion checking to Roar Money. BUT I love their Instacash! I love all their features.

Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time.
