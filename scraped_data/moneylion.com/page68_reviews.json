        "text": "I recently started using this application maybe a month or two so far and I plan to discontinue after my next pay off. I called and inquired on my 250 once I received notifications about being eligible when talking with a representative barely speaking good English he was very smug and proceeded to tell me they were providing more than enough, which realistically is a lie I get paid weekly and would have been qualified for 250 very dissatisfied with his response very bad customer service at the end of the day this isn’t the only application willing to give people money , let alone don’t act like y’all are doing folks a favor that’s what my bank is for if I ever needed a huge favor, I don’t recommend this app.\nUpdate 08/10/2022\nUpon placing my complaint on Trust Pilot the company has retaliated by unlinking my account taking the payout down to 25 when I had been approved for 175 when reaching out to a rep I informed them of an email I received about linking an account I also provided receipts that my account was already linked as I used their app a few times already with no issues up until I raised concerns , the company is discriminatory and will retaliate when they are in the wrong I do not recommend this app try other apps such as Dave. I have enough receipts to report their behavior to the bbb !\n08/16/2022\nBy far the crappiest company I’ve dealt with they went in an authorized a charge with out my consent to my bank I called and they would not refund the transaction as my bank had me call them back to see if they would reverse the pending charge as it has not posted they have caused me to be charged a fee with my bank due to their incompetence I was not made aware or provided a notice that they would take money from an account that had zero in it we all knows what happens there okay, they wouldn’t know that because of their lack of communication, I talked with two managers and was under the impression I would be refunded and the entire amount would come out on the 26th with the first guy & that wasn’t the case when I called back the second time , this company is a complete rip off that preys on minorities that speak out against their unjust and discriminatory actions then proceeded to show me a document that doesn’t explain anything about the amount they would take, & the time frame they would auto debit an account if it was not payed on time I plan to file a lawsuit against their actions. Avoid this app by any means necessary I wouldn’t wish my experience on an enemy , payday loans any sort of loan would be better than money lion they charge you tips and transfer fees if you opt to not leave a tip they will add whatever amount they want into what you owe, while making sure you do more than one withdrawals to redeem your full amount as you can only do increments of 100. Waste more money trying to borrow and pay back then a standard payday or bank loan, I hope they are shut down in the future and can not cause financial harm to anyone else.",

The only thing I don't like is the increments of money in which you can withdraw at a time. This is where they get their money and why I never leave a tip. The 7.99 fee per $100 increment adds up. You can send to your bank fee free, but that takes at least 2/3 business days. You should be able to withdraw the amount of your loan. If this were the case, I'd be more likely to leave a larger amount of a tip. But, all in all. I do love Moneylion.",

I recently got a credit builder loan, and this pay cycle, I paid my instacash loan off early. The app said I was again eligible for instacash, but when requested I got an error. When I asked the support chat why, it told me it was due to a “late credit builder loan payment” which is not due for another 2.5 weeks. \nI called their support line, who told me that even though the chat provided me an explanation in writing, the reasoning as well as the app stating that I am eligible for $355 in instacash — was not only incorrect, but they could not provide me with a reason that I was no longer eligible at all. \n\nI also had 13 fraudulent charges made on my Moneylion virtual card. So not only did an entire paycheck get taken in less than 24 hours due to fraud charges, but the ability to access instacash to have any money to use was also revoked, with support giving me ZERO information, and zero help. \n\nDo not use this app. It may seem great, I thought it was too for a while. But being a loyal and on time paying customer gets you absolutely nothing and support does not care about you or your money at all! \nNot only am I out an entire paycheck, but I also have zero support or even answers from the company that is supposed to be guarding my money. \nStay away from these guys.",
