They hang up in your face and end chats before you even get to explain anything! When you ask to speak to a supervisor it’s like you asking them to do a whole lot and it’s too much for them and try every way possible to get you to hang up what I mean by that is they put you on hold with this annoying ass sound for hours! These people put a hold of $570.75 of my money because I tryed to make a reservation for a car that only cost $465.60 by the way. The transaction declined so my money should still be in my account! There shouldn’t be no kind of hold to any on my money that I had in my account! Came to Georgia for my grandmothers funeral with my 6 children that I’m raising by myself and got stranded! I live In New Orleans, and my kids are missing a lot of school because of this! They don’t care because they not the ones it’s being done to so it’s funny to them! I was suppose to leave 09/22/20 and I’m stuck in Georgia with no money, no where to go, and can’t put my kids in school!",
