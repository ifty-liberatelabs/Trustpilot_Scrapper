This makes no sense because if you apply for a loan is because you need the money right away not in 1 year. Also they still not update the banks. If you got a Credit Union like me you can’t link it. All other companies use the same link process and they do have my bank. I emailed them millions of times about it and nothing. Before the loan was like 5% and now is 29.99%",
