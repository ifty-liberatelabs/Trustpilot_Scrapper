        "text": "I had high hopes of MoneyLion, but my experience has been frustrating from start to finish. The app promises seamless integration of investment tools, banking and credit monitoring, but it falls short in several areas.\n\nFirst, the app is riddled with bugs. It crashes frequently, and transactions take an unusually long time to process. I encountered delays in transferring funds, which is unacceptable when dealing with financial matters.\n\nSecond, the customer service is extremely unhelpful. it took me over a week to get a response to a simple inquiry, and when I did, the answers were vague and didn't resolve my issue. There is no sense of urgency or accountability.\n\nLastly, the investment option is very limited and not very helpful, despite their claims of personalised advice the advices are generalised and obsolete, I received cookie-cutter suggestions that didn't aling with my financial goal.\n\nI wouldn't recommend MoneyLion to anyone looking for a reliable investment platform if you are looking for that then check Bull Stash, they are a far better option, the experience has been smooth and customer support have been more than helpful. Save yourself the hassle and look to Bull Stash.",

I had to do my repayment manually due to this. ML allowed me to pay them back, borrow money this past Friday then Saturday my bank is no longer supported and my account wont link so that my insta cash payment amount shows up. They will not tell me why and their so called \"AGENTS\" will stop responding then ask you to take their stupid survey. I spoke to 8 different \"AGENTS\" which by the way all say the same damn thing and don't help you one bit. I'm disgusted by this; my bank is in the negative with lots of overdraft fees. I will be reporting to the BBB. ",

I have paid a credit Builder loan and I'm paying on another one right now and even pay the insta cash regularly back. I updated my information yesterday knowing today was early payday but for whatever reason the VA Paid me there instead. Not only did I not get paid today they're going to make me wait till Friday on the longest month knowing after I showed them proof me and my children will be out in the streets because of this they won't do anything but pretend to care while having every ability to actually do the right thing that is disgusting not just for business but it's the most inhumane thing I've ever seen people do and they are one of the only ones that do this kind of crap intentionally make people wait knowing that's the only thing that got our business in the first place. Takes a sick human being to work for places like this knowing most of us are barely making it if that just to do this kind of crap when they have the power to do better and I mean that these are some sick people I wouldn't even callthem human beings. To Outsource and pay people less money just because it's more money over there and then those people turn around and play in our faces like this it's a sick world. It already cost me so much money just to switch this will never happen again this is the worst excuse for a financial institution they have absolutely no respect for people or situations like this and I have to sit here and wait four days just to be out in the street counting down because they refuse to do the right thing.",

After I complained for not being offered a secured method to submit my sensitive personal documents my account was frozen, my access was taken away and a transaction dispute that I made very clear was an authorized transaction was purposely and erroneously presented to the merchant stating that there was no card holder authorization for the payment.  The merchant was my landlord and the authorized payment that should NOT have been disputed and that I have written confirmation from Money stating that they acknowledged my statement that the transaction was authorized and would be cancelled but even so the payment was reversed and I lost my place to live being forced to move out for non payment of rent and to avoid an eviction/judgement going on record.  I am now homeless and Manuel, Teresa and A Wagner from the legal department do not care.  They refuse to accept my valid government issued ID and refuse to show me documentation of money lion's policy that they are using to determine that my valid photo id is not acceptable.\nThanks for really giving this long standing and loyal member quite the experience.\nJUST GIVE ME MY MONEY AND STOP RUINING MY LIFE!!!!!!",

        "text": "Well here's my shocker this Sunday morning after my return to home from 3 days no business email use at all = Sunday morning I must send some polite notes as I had auto-reply telling all inbound I will have NO email contact for 3 days (and that's not the end of the world) and my very first email to be sent to a trusted mate and upon send I received \"error could not send as sender is blocked as suspected spam\" and I read that carefully and thought \"now hang on this message is telling me that I the sender is blocked\" and what the bloody heck is that? I took a chance on a Sunday morning and called up my ISP Go Daddy and wham bam Email Live Trouble Agent on line and I told them trouble. Took about 10 and told me \"yes your email is blocked as your email reported as spam by more than 50 receivers in one single day and we have the email sent in a mass blast. Asked me \"do you this email address YOU have in \"subject line\" of \"advertisinggo@moneylion\"? I said \"I have that Money Lion as an App on my phone and yes I have done some business with them\" and Go Daddy said not kidding \"well there was a mass blast email sent out using YOUR business email address meaning YOUR email address sent out more than 400 emails on Friday October 18 to 455 emails and we Go Daddy can only assume from your computer internal Outlook contacts list and more than 100 of those email marked as \"spam\" and that triggered the Go Daddy block\". So I say to Go Daddy \"now wait a minute you mean to tell me that my own business email sent out 455 emails and in subject line was Money Lion and body of email was an advertisement?\" Go Daddy says yes. Took about 20 more minutes to go through web forms to deny this action and Go Daddy says my emails outbound should be \"released\" within 24-48 HOURS. That means all my emails that should be going out today Sunday and all day Money = no-go. Because Money Lion hacked into my email list and sent out THEIR advertising using MY OWN email address!!! WOW!!! Criminal!!!",
