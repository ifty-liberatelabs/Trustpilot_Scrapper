Of course, if you‚Äôve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You‚Äôll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly. ",

Please read the chat I had with customer service about an offer that was given to me: I was never told about any restrictions were on my account and was pretty much told I should‚Äôve known better, that ‚Äúthey were email blasts‚Äù when in fact not one was an email they appeared in my app after I submitted membership payment. All activities that involve me benefiting were suspended until this goes through but the membership benefits that involve me giving my money to them all work fine ü§î. I offered to call my bank with them to confirm payment i offered to call  my employment with them to confirm earnings. I offered to pay with a debit card: Nope. Pretty much got told it was a promo why did you believe us. \n\nUSER: presence message \n\nAGENT (Ted G.): Hi John, thank you for contacting MoneyLion Customer Care. How can I help you today? \n\nUSER: presence message \nUSER: Hi I just would‚Äôve loved a legitimate answer to my concerns. I never would‚Äôve signed up direct deposit if I hadn‚Äôt received these messages over and over and over \nUSER: presence message \nUSER: downloadable message \nUSER: Sign up for direct deposit then be told there are mitigating circumstances around this offer that aren‚Äôt added in the initial communication \nUSER: No my wages are linked to you and I don‚Äôt have what you said I would \nUSER: And my account is set to deposit to money lion \n\nAGENT (Ted G.): What do you mean? Can you tell me more about what happened? \n\nUSER: I wouldn‚Äôt have even done this because if my ptment method at door dash stayed the same I cash out daily for what I earn \nUSER: but now I have to wait until it gets received by you and I didn‚Äôt get the benefit that I was offered. \nUSER: Just ridiculous \n\nAGENT (Ted G.): I see here you contacted us earlier about a decreased Instacash limit, correct? \n\nUSER: And no one seems to want to address any of the mistakes or errors made trying to make it seem like there was fault on my end for not receiving the instant pay boost. \nUSER: Yes I did. \nUSER: But now I can‚Äôt cash out daily from my work because it s attached to money lion and I don‚Äôt get the advance you said I would \nUSER: presence message \nUSER: I offers to contact my bank together to confirm the membership fee and contact DoorDash to get history of earnings and earnings towards this pay check but all I have receive is an answe tkajng about an ACH time. \nUSER: presence message \nUSER: Mind you this is not mentioned any where in the offfes I received \nUSER: Just  ridiculous. \n\nAGENT (Ted G.): I'm very sorry to hear about what happened. Let me go ahead and look this up for you. I'll check everything here. Let me pull up the account. \nAGENT (Ted G.): Do you mind if I take two minutes to look into this for you? \n\nUSER: presence message \nUSER: downloadable message \nUSER: there‚Äôs another one that kept popping up. \nUSER: Nothing about ach payment or anything no warning or message or anything. And now I‚Äôm being told To look at some policy that I never would‚Äôve cared about and I wouldn‚Äôt have even done this direct deposit thing if it wasn‚Äôt in my face on every other screen \n\nAGENT (Ted G.): Hi, Thanks for patiently waiting. Upon checking, I can see here that you're not qualified for an Insatcash boost because of the missed membership fee. \n\nUSER: So I‚Äôve been told over and over yet I received these offers over and over \nUSER: I offered to call the td bank to confirm funds for the payment I submitted earlier today, but it would‚Äôve been nice to know I wasn‚Äôt eligible at some point during that whole process \nUSER: Now it just looks like you were trying to bait me into having my money come here without giving me proper notice of any restrictions. If this sounds like it‚Äôs ok and defensible by what you‚Äôre telling me hey that‚Äôs what you get with Money lion I suppose \n\nAGENT (Ted G.): Yes, I can see here that it's scheduled to be taken out tomorrow. This usually takes 3-5 business days to clear. \n\nUSER: But I‚Äôm angry because I will be now without funds I was expecting \nUSER: You guys should never have sent me those offers and defending why after the fact makes you guys look like a group that no one should trust with their finances \nUSER: presence message \n\nAGENT (Ted G.): It's an email blast,  John. Terms and Conditions applied.  \n\nUSER: No one even wants to own the fact that those promos were sent to me were wrong in the first place \nUSER: I guess that just makes me stupid right ? \nUSER: Ok well I‚Äôm over the whole thing I just needed to get to is all out and have someone try and exp",
