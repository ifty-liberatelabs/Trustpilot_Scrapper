No calls from supervisors as requested. Update. Still no action on Money Lionsnpart.  No supervisor call as promised 24 hrs ago.  Really disappointed in the poor response of MoneyLion on something that was their mistake. Update. I have filled out their requested form twice and two complaint forms twice still no response fro Money Lion only an email saying my payment was rejected.  This can’t be that hard to fix",

Highly recommended.",
