So, I submitted my request, gave my bank details, my socia security number, bank info, and where I work. \nThe website, quickly made a contract and all i had to do was click the box with e-signature. Of course, I didn't because the amount offered was less than 10% of what I requested. \nThe loan company was MaxLend, and they were expecting me to sign a 704% interest rate. Yes, SEVEN HUNDRED FOUR PERCENT interest rate. with payment of $300+ for every biweekly pay period. The loan amount was for $1050. The payback was $5,000+. How could this platform allow this finance company onto their platform. ",

        "text": "One star because I couldn’t give zero. Moneylion used to be good to me and something changed about a year ago and now it’s just unbelievable. They offer products but when you go to link your bank account to the product so you can utilize them they don’t even List their own bank. Money line is an option so for the loans and the “credit building perks“ are virtually useless. But they sure take out their fees every month they send you random options for Credit building and then or cash advances etc., and when you try to take advantage of them, and of course you have to have a MoneyLion account to do this BUT!!  your Moneylion account IS NOT an option to repay the loans or the advances so they are useless.  I can’t take advantage of ANY OF THE SO-CALLED ADVANTAGES BECAUSE THEY DON’T EVEN ACCEPT THEMSELVES AS A REPAYMENT OPTION!!  BECAUSE THEY’RE NOT A BANK I GUESS IT’S RIDICULOUS. I HAD AT LEAST FIVE LOANS WITH THEM ALL IN GOOD STANDING ALL PAID OFF ON TIME AND THEN SUDDENLY I DIDN’T QUALIFY OR BETTER YET I COULDN’T REPAY THEM WITH MY MONEYLION ROLL MONEY ACCOUNT BECAUSE IT WASN’T LISTED AS A REPAYMENT OPTION SO I WENT TO THE WOW ACCOUNT JUST TO HAVE THE SAME NONSENSE. THE ONLY REASON I KEEP THIS ACCOUNT IS BECAUSE I DON’T WANNA GO THROUGH THE HASSLE OF CHANGING MY SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENT AND THEY DO ALLOW ME INSTA CASH SINCE I’M WRITING THIS THEY’LL PROBABLY CUT THAT OFF TOO..  welcome to Moneylion y’all oh and if you try and get a manager, they just hang up on you or tell you that you’ll get the same response and then they tell you that there’s no way possible no human can override their algorithms if it were me, I’d probably start looking at mysystem because we’re real people and not everybody lives on algorithm and if you can’t control your own company and override things I would look at some different software whatever it is what it is.
