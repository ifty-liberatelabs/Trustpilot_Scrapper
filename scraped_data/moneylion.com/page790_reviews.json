I had a refund issued by an airline for a cancelled flight that they didn’t credit to my account. I still keep getting no answers as to why it’s not there and being told just to wait longer. Constant push offs and promises of call backs. Investment accounts that can’t be cashed out. Offering credit building programs that require you to have a money lion account and external account. I’ve never had a financial organisation that is so shady and horrible to their customer base. Steer clear of this one!\n\n****UPDATE*****\nWas contacted via phone and email on Dec 11th. This was at 530 pm est. OUTSIDE OF THEIR BUSINESS HOURS. Email asked me to call supervisor “KAYLA” but provided me with a number that only accepts calls Monday-Friday. It also said I could reply to the email with questions. The voicemail stated that the full amount owed would be in my account 12/14/2020. I then received a second email on 12/13/2020 at 7:00pm stating that because I had failed to respond the matter was now closed. \n\nI still do not have the funds owed and now have to start this disgusting process all over. This company now has 3 class action lawsuits open to the public. I have added my name to them and heartily suggest you do the same. This is infuriating and has also been reported to the BBB. It should not take weeks and then poor reviews on the internet to get any action done... then to be screwed like this again.",
