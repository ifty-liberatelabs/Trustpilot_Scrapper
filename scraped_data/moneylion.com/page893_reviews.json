I tried and tried to fix it but couldn't figure it out so i made a compliment with customer service amd nothing was done and to this day its still Bethmichelle smh. Im not from Arkansas i definitly dont need my name spelled lile that. And i fimd it disrespectful to be honest. It pretty much means to me that u dont take me serious and that im not important enough to take the time to fix my little issue. But so far its a good lil bank. Oh and one more thing..... It take so long to initially sign in. I Mean your stuck on rhe first little picture of the lion and the name for at least a minute. That needs to be cut dont into lile half that time. Thanks",
