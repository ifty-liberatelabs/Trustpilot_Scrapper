Delay tactic by Scammerlions.\n\nI am having a HORRIBLE experience not only with the app but with the company in general. The customer service phone number cannot be found anywhere on the app or website. It is extremely difficult to reach a live person. They tell you one thing and then do another. I have a copy of a transcript with an agent and I verified multiple times which account the transfer was going too. The information is on the agents screen right? Transaction date? Amount? From To where? Guess what, it was transferred to a closed account, that \"couldn't\" be removed in the app. What kind of circus show is going on over there? They make you wait days for a resolution even though it was their mistake. Nobody in customer service can help you, they say \"your issue has been escalated\" but recieve no communication afterwards unless you contact them. They do loans, banking, and even stock trading. I know I am not the only one these guys are trying to screw. Send your complaints to the FCC and BBB with proof of their shady business practices. \n\nThey put me on hold for a supervisor then I get a recording saying no one is available for 300 minutes and they close shop in 15 minutes. I am so upset how a company like this is allowed to cheat and lie to its customers with no compassion especially in this crazy covid19 pandemic.  They don't care about you only your money that they make you jump through multiple hoops to get back. Trust me. Delete the app. Block the url. You are welcome, I saved you a living nightmare.",
