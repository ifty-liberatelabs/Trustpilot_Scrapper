I spent the $10 every day for over 20 days And I didn’t get my entire $20 back. Also customer service is nonexistent and I mean nonexistent. Good luck getting somebody on the phone\n\nYeah the loan is nice but I’d rather get a loan at a higher rate somewhere else and be able to communicate with somebody. I won’t keep any money with them\n\nA little money that you get back on transactions is a nice touch though. But you can do that with Stash as well and get actual stock back \n\nNot for everybody. They serve their purpose even if it is incredibly annoying to deal with them\n\n\nEDIT: I paid my loan off a couple of weeks ago and I STILL got charged a membership fee LOL",

They have no money to give you even if it is not your fault. My entire pay check is gone.\nThe bank refused to assist initially, requested for paper copies, said blah blah blah we are a paper free company.\nFinally in the mail after 3 months, they say after their investigation they found that those transactions were not fraudulent.\nLol, I am closing my account and will stick with other banks that are at least insured.",

If you are in a bind you can even defer your repayment until your next paycheck. I would highly recommend them if you are in need of a cash advance. They also offer other options like a credit builder card and loan options from other providers. Money lion gets my vote!!",
