        "text": "I would strongly discourage anybody from even downloading this app. They charge a $10 feeTWICE A month. Not monthly but twice a month. Even better is I did a credit building loan through them &amp; while u have a loan open\nWith them I guess u also have to pay the $10 every 2 Weeks on top of your payments. Well I didn’t know this &amp; after having the loan open for 4 months w/ no issues I get a notice from CREDIT KARMA telling me I have a negative remark from MONEY LION. Because I was 32 days late on one of my every other weekly membership payments.   What’s even better is I had gotten a New debit card &amp;\nSwitched all my bills over w/ no Issues including my loan. But I did f even know I had been paying this regularly. So on my “Credit Building” Liam. It actually hurt my credit. Plus. It’s not even a real loan. They don’t loan u anything. U just pay in money &amp; u get MIST  OF IT BACK WHEN U FINISh BUT NOT ALL. THEY KEEP SOME of it.  THEY LITERALLTy CHARGE  INTEREST ON A LOAN THEY DONT GIVE WHEN THEY SHOULD BE PAYing ME INTEREST BEcAUSE THEYre HOLDING MT MOney.  It makes no sense at all.   FINALLY,  when this happened I just told them I wanted to Pay my balance off & be done w/ the loan so it doesn’t hurt my credit even more.  They told me I had to pay to catch up on memebership payments first but once I do that then I’ll get the $833 they owed me within 2-3 days. So I paid the Membership fees.  4 days later I hadn’t received the $ so I called them & they said that I still had to pay my last payment on my loan.  Even tho the\nDue date would have been the day before this day. Meaning they Said if Have my money by now? After arguing a little I just asked that “once I pay this. That means I’ll now get another $55 back right?  Since it just comes right back?”  They confirmed that I would. So I paid it. Then they said itd now be 3-5 days?  Idk why all of a sudden the time frame got longer but that’s what I was told.  Anyways. 6 days later.  No payment. I called again. They said they sent my money to the wrong account!  My old bank that I literally deleted off the account. The same one that they couldn’t get the membership payment from.  So they told me I had to wait for this bank\nTo send the $ back (which I later learned was a huge lie). The next day I called my old bank & asked them if they had any deposit attempts to my old account & they replied “No, & if we get them they are immediately blocked & not even accepted so they should never not have that $ for any reason”. When I called MONEY LION back & explained this I was passed around to several People until I got a supervisor who was a HUGE D****. He was incredibly rude & kept talking over me & interrupting me & telling me that I was wrong & u know what they did. THEY REFUSED TO PAY ME BACK MY MONEY!  Literally they still haven’t paid me back. Even at the end of the phone call they give u a chance to leave a review & this supervisor refused to hang up on their line. I sat on the phone with him for a half hour not talking & him occasionally telling me to “hang up the line” & id tell him I couldn’t but he refused to. It was a SUPER SHADY situation. This was about 3-4 weeks ago. Still haven’t received my money. But even if they did pay me back what they owe me I would still lose money from the interest I pay THEM for holding my money. Which Makes No sense.  Plus the “Credit Builder” loan hurt my credit & they haven’t even reported the loan being paid off yet & I can’t even find records of the payments that I paid regularly on time. This is a huge scam of an app. I would run far. Delete the app & never look back. I promise u you’ll regret doing business with them if u don’t. I will come back & update this if they ever decide to pay me my money or at the least apologize.",

I hate that. \nPros:\nCan get the loan easily.(Don’t have to have the best credit)\nInstacash is always available.\nAutopay for repayment.\nUser friendly app.\nCan use the debit card anywhere.\n\nCons:\nAlways want you to leave a tip when you instacash per transaction.\nCan’t pay extra on your payments. Either make your monthly payments or pay in full.\nThe instant transfer fee is expensive $3.99-$5.00 per transactions.  \n\nOverall MoneyLion has been great to me.",

You see, it takes a big team here at MoneyLion to keep 0% APR Instacash running smoothly 24/7. When it comes to disbursement, we also have options wherein our customer can have their cash advances on their MoneyLion checking account for free and it would only take 1-2 business days.

They have terrible customer service, they don’t care about their customers. All they do is say they’re going to “escalate the ticket” and you nothing gets done. I would never work with them again and if they don’t fix the issue immediately, they’ll be facing a lawsuit.",
