We were supposed to get the money from the credit reserve, money that we are entitled to. The loan was paid off on October 2nd, and we still have not received our money. This put us in such a financial bind, made our checking account negative, etc. We have children. We explained all of this to money lion and they did not care. Kept telling us to wait. With ever new promise they made, they broke several others. If you call and ask to speak to a supervisor, they put you on hold for 5 mins then hang up on you. This happened to me every single time I tried to call and ask to speak to a supervisor. 3 times back to back just today alone. Then I was told a supervisor would call me back, and of course they never did. SHAME ON MONEY LION!!! Oh, and then they \"boosted our instacash a measly $25 while we \"wait longer\" that 25 dollars doesn't make up for the $150 that my account is now negative because of YOU plus I have to pay the $25 back, plus the fee! So thanks for nothing money lion. You're a garbage company who holds people money! Beware to everyone who uses moneylion!! Not only did they screw me over on my money, they made sure to take out their fee 2 times today, which made me more negative in my account. Unacceptable company with horrific morals. I'm taking this to my local news station and letting them see what kind of people really run moneylion. Not only did you cause my bank account to go negative, you told me to GFMS. Won't even fix a problem YOU CAUSED!!",
