        "text": "I sent a payoff for my credit builder plus loan via cashier's check on June 26, 2023. I have been calling every week for an explanation as to why my loan has not been paid off. I called my bank to place a stop pay on the check the other day but was informed that the check was deposited into their account on July 24,2023. Everytime I speak with a customer care specialist they say it has not arrived to them and they have to escalate the issue to another department to be researched and they will email me. When asked to speak to that department, I was told they could not allow the customer to be in contact with them. I barely receive any correspondence from them regarding the issue. Today I had to demand to speak with a supervisor and the supervisor read the same script until I told him I was going to obtain legal counsel. I am going to sue them for emotional distress, attorney fees, etc because this is ridiculous. Their customer service also sucks because as a customer you have to repeat yourself with every person you speak with even when they do a warm transfer. Everyone reads from the same script and there is no personalized genuine engagement with the customer.  \n\nUpdate: I just received an email stating they did receive the check and are processing my payoff after I left my reviews and informed them that I was seeking legal counsel to resolve this issue. Lol such a coincidence\n\nUpdate/reply: My issue is not resolved yet because my payoff has not been processed almost 1 month after my check was deposited into their business account. I'm still being charged interest, regular payments, and membership fees. Can anyone say suspicious activity/emotional distress?",

        "text": "Still haven’t received my money as of 8/2/23…On July 1st I did a transfer incorrectly. Rather than doing a transfer from my MoneyLion acct to my Navy acct, I did it from my Navy to MoneyLion. That day, my Navy acct couldn’t cover the transfer request. Navy required me pay $29 for insufficient funds but MoneyLion has put a block on my acct since then. They requested pictures of my drivers license, front and back. A copy of my bank statement and a photo. The problem with my bank statement is it says absolutely nothing about a transaction. With MoneyLion because no transfer was made. My statement says payment of $29, insufficient funds. Nothing about MoneyLion because nothing went through. I have called every week and been told “it’s being escalated”. I’ve also been told I need to submit the pictures of license, myself and bank statement 4 times counting today. The total amount is only $750. I contacted the BBB and they are looking into this but I am absolutely spreading the word on MoneyLion. Everyday I tell at least 1 person about this to spread the word. I made the initial mistake but it’s 4 weeks later. Oh yeah, I also took a screenshot of the incorrect transfer request. I sent this to them as well as additional proof of who I am. Since it’s time stamped and shows a date it further backs my identity and explains the issue… apparently not though.",

When I asked about this it all fell apart. First I was told that my direct deposit was being deposited to my debit card so that was the why, then I when I proved that was incorrect it was I didn’t have enough consecutive deposits, I’ve had the same account for years, and it was one thing after the other. My bank told me I was being scammed and would be better off to cut my losses and run. I think they’re right.",
