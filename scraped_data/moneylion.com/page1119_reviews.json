        "text": "The rep I spoke with during a chat was great. Had to clean up something the previous rep I spoke to a few weeks ago didn’t handle. Issue was with making my membership payments from my Chase Account. Took forever to find out because my payments were declining and I don’t understand why as the money was always available.... it was switched to my Roar Account. Transferred money to that account to make Membership Payments and it declined again. I wanted to make all the payments to catch up and now the app is only letting me do one payment at a time every 5 days and that just sucks. I’ve been been trying to handle all of this for two (2) months and I just finally got some hope. It should give me option to pay all or pay one to reactivate. I know it’s hard times but I shouldn’t have to wait 5 days for very payment missed to catch it up. By time I’m done, two more payments will be due!!! I’m literally trying to pay you and you’re stopping me. The fact it takes 5 days to process and Credit Plus payment from a direct account with MoneyLion is weird to me. I understand outside banks. But I hope this can help change processing time etc",

        "text": "I filed a BBB complaint on July 27th. I took out the money lion credit builder loan in April, as of July 22nd I had it completely paid off. I contacted them that day, of course they tell me the payment is still processing and I have to wait 5 business days. So I do, I check the app everything is fully processed but no access to the escrow account. I called money lion 4 different times, each time getting disconnected except for the 4th. Finally get a representative and he tells me it has processed but the escrow (money I have paid to money lion) will not be accessed for another 5 business days. I paid $736 on Wednesday in hopes to pay my loan off and get the earned escrow. Now my account is negative they are not helping me get access to my funds and I’ve already been on the phone for 20+ minutes I get a representative first giving me one answer then a supervisor Shelby telling me a completely different response.  Fast forward to today, where it took 40 minutes to get a supervisor on the phone her name was Clarissa; who informed me I never spoke with Shelby and there are not any notes on the account. Still haven’t received escrow funds, they haven’t responded to BBB complaint NEVER GO THROUGH MONEY LION THEY ARE A SCAM",
