            "message": "Hi Roxanne! We're glad to hear that you've enjoyed Instacash! We created Instacash to help you access extra money to cover everyday essentials, unexpected expenses, and we designed it to be easy to repay. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash advances in increments of $100 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $100, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in an advance of up to $100 at a time. Your repayment date is based around your pay date. We'd like to take a look at your account to make sure we have all of the information is accurate with your repayment date. Please email our Customer Advocacy team at CustomerAdvocacy@MoneyLion.com and include reference number MLSK9Q2D. We look forward to finding a solution for you.",

So that way we can know if we have bills coming up it will let us pull back out the same amount I was able to pull out $560 as a pay day loan after I paid it back it dropped to 315 and I was on hold for over a half hour because I had rent due and couldn’t get the rest of the money in time",
