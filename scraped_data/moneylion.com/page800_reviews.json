As i became familiar with how the app is designed i was like \"Wow! This is really cool!!\"Thing's like adding multiple accounts in one convenient place, the helpful advice and truths about my spending, credit score builders, and investments. I'm really learning a lot about stocks and how to increase my cash flow. It took a few weeks because i had to meet income deposit requirements but i finally got Instacash! It was generous and very much needed! I must say Money lion has saved my finances and made me feel proud of my money making decisions. I'd highly recommend this to anyone that wants to succeed with there investment future or just want a smart bank to join!  Its not a prepaid card you can use it as you would a traditional bank complete with check cashing options you can do in the privacy of your own home or anywhere...no lines and waiting.Its suited my needs perfectly! Money lion makes saving money and adulting fun again!",

            "message": "Hi Michelle,\nThe amount of Instacash you are eligible to receive is based on a variety of factors, including your MoneyLion account history, deposit and spending activity, repayment history, and other risk-based factors, as determined by MoneyLion in its sole discretion, and may change from time to time. Therefore, demonstrating consistent direct deposits and on-time payments can increase your Instacash eligibility, while a negative change in these factors could lower your Instacash eligibility. \n\nOne of the best ways to ensure higher amounts of Instacash is connecting your direct deposits to a RoarMoney account. The same direct deposit when detected in RoarMoney (vs. an external bank account) will unlock TWICE the Instacash. You will always be informed of your current available Instacash amount in the MoneyLion mobile app. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please contact us.",
