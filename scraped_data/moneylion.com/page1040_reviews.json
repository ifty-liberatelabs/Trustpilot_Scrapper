        "text": "Yes the reason that I'm giving y'all a rating of a 3 is because you'll charge me a $3 late fee and I have not ever been late on none of my payments I paid before the due date and just because I didn't tip you all the first time I asked for money when I go to a bank I don't tip the teller when they give me money or cash my check so why should I tip you for supplying me with the money. Your like  a payday loan it get a little bit of extra money before payday and I don't need to be tipping y'all and if you're because I don't tip you that is just that'. I do like the quick and Speedy service of being able to have extra money on hand to be able to get it and not have the hassle of filling out paperwork and all that good stuff. I do appreciate that and thanks for covering me financially whenever I need it. Thanks again sincerely James Dean Myers II",
