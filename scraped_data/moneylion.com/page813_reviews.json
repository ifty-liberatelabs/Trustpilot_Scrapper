They didn't even start me with a low amount of money when I first began. And they even boost the amount of money they will let you borrow in a really short amount of time. The only complaint I have is that you can only request in increments of 50..so there may be no apr % but everytime you take a 50 you pay 4 or 5 dollars for it to go into account right away and then also leave a tip. You don't have to leave a tip but even without the tip id be paying 20 dollars to borrow 200.",

For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly.",
