Safe to say I will no longer use your app and will not recommend to anyone. Also, the reason for the $50 limitation is so that you can get you 4.99 fee with every $50 advance.

Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time.
