Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time.

I have been trying to speak with a manager for the past 5 days. In that time I have been hung up on, told I would get a call back which never happened and I have been lied to. After I receive the money I have been entitled to I will cancel my subscription and close my account. My advice, keep away from these crooks.",
