        "text": "Overall, I’ve been happy with all the features of MoneyLion. I use Chime for my bill pay since I started out with it first, and then found out about MoneyLion. It has plenty of excellent features, including tips on building your credit, third party loan offers, credit score checks, investment portfolios, and of course the great Instacash, and more.  But I’ve found them to not be consistent with how they work the due date or the amount of the loan on that. On July 2, for instance, I borrowed $50, and it didn’t even surprise me when the due date was July 2. I just rolled my eyes in my head thinking here we go again. It does no good to message them because they always have some technical reason for why it’s done what it did, and you gotta live with it, like it or not. However, I tried again later and it did what it’s supposed to do, due date next month when I get paid.  Last month it was so messed up I tried to get them to explain to me why the due date is due only a few days later instead of when I get paid on the first and I never did understand the person’s reasoning, I think they’re trained to talk so techie that you just have no room to argue and have to accept it. I did get them to move the due date to the 28th, since we get our check two days early.  Shouldn’t MoneyLion know they get my direct deposit two days early each month?  You’d think.  But my dd didn’t come in on the 28th and I thought it was rude of them to pull what payment they could out of Chime (I didn’t have the full amount in Chime at that time of the month). Them doing that caused a transaction from a lender to be declined from insufficient funds. I do feel that since MoneyLion knows exactly when they receive my monthly dd, they could’ve been more respectful and waited for it to arrive rather than take what money they could get out of my other bank, causing me stress. The bottom line though, MoneyLion has many helpful and excellent features for the consumer, and in my opinion, they need to work on consistency with the Instacash feature so as to prevent all the unnecessary stress for the consumer.",

Over $1700 in advances were made and over a thousand dollars of it repaid from my checking account. I called and reported this right as I saw it. \n\nAfter getting off the phone with the support lady I saw an email that said the phone number on my account 585-540-0923 was used to connect to a different account and was then disconnected from my account. I told the lady on the phone several times that that was NOT my phone number. So why, after I reported this was this phone number allowed to connect to another account?! How is that now flagged as suspicious activity?\n\nI have so many questions. After this person changed the phone number and then immediately after started making instacash withdrawals, why wasn’t that flagged as suspicious activity? And after they paid back the advances and then made MORE advances, why was that not flagged as suspicious activity? When they used all of the advanced funds to make two large purchases from a place in Hong Kong WHY WAS THAT NOT FLAGGED AS SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY? When they changed the phone number on my account, why didn’t I get an email? Why was there no two step authentication? \n\nI need answers. They took everything.",
