I currently have a outstanding BBB complaint filed due to negligence and failure to uphold a contract. So be wary on doing business outside the instacash. They replied, on my review, as of 3/11/21 the matter is still unresolved and told me there is nothing they could do even though it was their mistake. Be wary of the positive sounding response if your able to view it.",

        "text": "Been a long time customer, paid off several \"credit builder\" loans but after this last fiasco, I would not recommend using them to anyone because they're extremely incompetent and totally screwed me along the way.\n\nI recently paid off my 6th credit builder loan and was offered a new one for $500, $300 of which would be sent to my bank account. However they sent the money to an account I closed 6 months ago and had long deleted from my wallet. So I had to call in and was assured they had fixed the issue and the money would be sent to the correct account, however they sent the money to the closed account anyway and the money never arrived as promised and was voided.\n\nSo I had to then call in again to be told to uninstall the app and try again and that would fix the issue, so I did it and when I log back in, it's treating me like it's the first time I used the app and only approved me for $100 of a $500 loan, something I did the FIRST time I used this app TWO YEARS ago!\n\nMoral of the story, don't bother with Moneylion, they can't do anything, the app rules supreme and the humans behind the scenes are incompetent and rude. Look at how they treat good customers like me so how will they treat you?",
