Just be sure to read the screens and make your selections carefully, and you can use Instacash without tips or fees if you choose. That said, if you choose to leave a tip — thank you! It helps us cover the costs of providing 0% APR cash advance to many, many folks like you!\n",

These “membership” fees are supposed to be invested in some sort of stock which you can then get back. Even thought I put in hundreds of dollars in, I’m told that my investments are worth $1. How pathetic. They also ask for a tip 3 different times when you request instacash ON TOP OF the $4.99 fee that they charge. I had $100 worth of instacash available, yet I could only take out $50 increments and had to pay the fee twice. They beg for a tip 3 times during one process of taking out instacash, and in one of those three times, after you click “no” they switch it up to $5 which you can change, but most people will press the cash out button before realizing that they’ve been deceived. Super invasive tactics, and where is my investment money!???! What a scam of a company.",
