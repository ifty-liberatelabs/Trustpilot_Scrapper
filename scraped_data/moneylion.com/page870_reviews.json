They do it like this so by the time you borrow $200, you owe them $28 more which is more than 20% so it's not really any difference in a traditional loan except the fact that you dont have the option to pay later. I had to quarantine so my check from work was really short. They took the payment for the money I had borrowed and only offered half of that in the new offer putting me in a worse situation.",
