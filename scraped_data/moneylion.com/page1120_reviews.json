I guess they have been working on their app and maybe the agreement with the new bank made it happen. The app and their customer service still need work, but this is progress. Hopefully there won't be any setbacks. A lot of potential here as I stated previously just needs some work! Maybe patience will pay off in the end. Great job Moneylion.",

I can’t believe how much better it’s gotten. I even retransmitted my direct deposits to this acct instead of my hometown bank. I’m very happy. Use all the features and you will find yourself being smarter about money in no time. It is truly helpful. Just so you know...I’ve had my account almost 2 yrs and I still have my hometown bank.
