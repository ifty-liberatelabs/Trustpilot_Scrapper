I gave only three stars due to the fact that the Insta cash feature is deceivingly expensive. Zero APR is true however the other fees associated set an actual APR over 500%.First time I used this feature cash was instantly deposited into my bank account for a fee And deposits are capped at $50 regardless of amount available to you I’m assuming to charge you an additional fee. Tips are not required but changing the default tip Will take a couple of attempts if you’re not paying attention you will pay an automatic high tip amount. The second time I used this feature after having set up a money roar account Money was deposited into that account not my bank making the instant part useless and a waste of money for the additional fees since it takes two days to transfer to your bank. To summarize great app highly recommend it is slightly expensive and does need some fine-tuning.",

            "message": "Hi Greg, \nWe created Instacash to help you access extra money to cover everyday essentials and unexpected expenses, and we designed it easy to repay. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash advances in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time. Instacash funding is FREE if you choose standard delivery, which takes only 24-48 hours. If you need your Instacash extra fast, you can choose instant Turbo funding for $4.99 (or $3.99 if you have our RoarMoney bank account). The Turbo fee is totally optional and just helps us cover the cost of delivering your cash advance instantly when you’re in a pinch. Tipping is optional, and whether you choose to tip doesn’t affect your eligibility in any way. Pay what you think is fair, or don't pay at all, it's up to you. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly.",

Do not use their credit builder (\"credit blower\" is more like it) product\n When you pay it off they automatically send a late pay to all 3 credit bureaus! Twice this happened to me causing a combined hit of over 120 points to my score and erasing all my hard work over 12 month period during a pandemic and economic downturn no less!!! I believed them the first time when they said it was a system glitch and took them up on the second offer. Nope! It happened like clockwork again when I paid off the loan. I have filed complaints with the federal government, CFPB, OCC, Texas Attorney General office as this a blatant violation of UDAAP. This has cost me thousands of dollars and housing approvals! Moneylion is scamming people and forcing them to stay in a certain credit tier. Investigate Rohit Chopra! Predatory lender. AVOID!",
