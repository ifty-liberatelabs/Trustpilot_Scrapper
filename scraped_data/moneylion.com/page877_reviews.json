We created Instacash to help you access extra money to cover everyday essentials and unexpected expenses, and we designed it to be easy to pay back. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you‚Äôve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You‚Äôll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time.
