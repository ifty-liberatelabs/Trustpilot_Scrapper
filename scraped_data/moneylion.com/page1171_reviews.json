        "text": "The idea of how it works is good but the way it actually works has flaws. My major issue is their customer service. They are hard to get to both on the phone and via email. When you do get them they are NOT helpful and you get different answers each time even with the same question. I have been a customer for a long time now and have done multiple loans with them. They are usually easy to do everything yourself with the app. Its when you have an issue & NEED customer service that the issues come from. I had changed checking accounts with my primary bank and notified them so the payments could come out of the new account number. As far as I knew they updated it and for the last six mths my payments processed fine and i paid off my loan so I could request a new one which went thru fine. When I did the new loan there is no way to verify the acount info or change it during the process of req a new loan for  an existising client. So my dep went to the old closed acount. My bank ( called and verf) returned it to them the next day as is normal for an ach dep to a closed act. It has now been a full week of trying to get customer service to fix it and all they say is 3 to 5 business days ( which it has now been). So now they will be taking out a pmt from my CORRECT account tomorrow for a loan I still do not have as they keep saying it hasn't been returned to them yet. Their customer service either are not trained to HELP clients or just have no incentive to care to. This is all due to them only updateing my acount info for pmts and not at the same time updating the credit one as well. So now 6 mths after I gave them the info for my new act they still had the old info and used it. They have so far offered no resolution to this other than to wait and check again tomorrow. I req it as I needed it over a week ago, now I have had to use a diffrent loan service and pay a much higher rate due to their error. I am unsure at this time if I will even req the new loan now or just have them cancel it at this point as there is really no incentive it stay with them due to their HORIBLE customer service.",

There are always issues with the app. Most of the time it's prompting you to set up your account which it is already set up. Being able to transfer money from one account to another seam to be down whenever you need it and the instant cash option it works sporadically. When I've needed to reach someone I have after a small wait BUT they refused to help even though they have the ability to. My account is/was frozen for 4+ days because a deposit included my husband's name as well as the first 7 letters of my last name (tax return) and they were unable to confirm that my name was on it. I have a very long and unusual name so this was not the case. I still don't have access to my account even though it was their mistake and they promised my account would be accessible 48 working hours! When I call they claim I did not then claim that my request to unlock my account was not received when the rep admitted to speaking to me. On top of it Moneylion is not an actual bank but a 3rd party \"bank\" the bank that actually holds your money is Lincoln savings. Do not use moneylion as your primary account or you will regret it!",
