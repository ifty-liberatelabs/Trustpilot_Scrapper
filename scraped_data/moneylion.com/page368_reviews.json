        "text": "Here's the thing with money lion. If you do not have good credit they do help build credit with the whole loan program, the only problem I have is that literally once you calculate up all the fees that they charge you every month for that loan you've paid $120 in membership fees for a year and I'd say about an extra 40 bucks for interest & for me I rather just use a credit card. My interest wasn't that high though because I made sure to pay more every time I made a payment to bring my interest rate down but even the instacash, I feel bad because they ask you to leave a tip but dang by the time you take out the little money they charge you $5 to put it on your own debit card if you put it on their debit card you still have to pay a $3 fee at an ATM plus a dollar fee to them for using an outside ATM which totals up to $4, shoot you might as well slap on the extra buck and put it on your own debit card. Once it's time to pay them back I've already hit $15 in fees so to me that's their tip right tthere They only allow you to take out $50 at a time and every single time you take out money instantly you must pay the fee for it so if someone is hurting bad and they need to hit insta-cash up for 300 bucks you are looking at $30 dollars in payback fees. THEY DO GIVE YOU A FREE OPTION WHICH TAKES ABOUT 2 TO 3 DAYS TO TRANSFER TO YOUR BANK SO IF YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE STRUGGLING FOR THE WEEK YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND DO THAT AHEAD OF TIME. I guess I appreciate the app overall which is why I'm giving them this review because they have helped me out in moments where I didn't know what I was going to do.",

If you qualify, you’ll get a personalized loan offer of up to $1,000. The offer will show you how much of your loan funds you’ll get right away and how much will be saved in a Credit Reserve Account and given to you when you’ve paid your loan in full. This is to help you save while you build credit!\n\nLike you also mentioned in your review Instacash funding is FREE if you choose standard delivery, which takes only 24\\-48 hours. If you need your Instacash extra fast, you can choose instant Turbo funding for $4.99 \\(or $3.99 if you have our RoarMoney bank account\\).

Just like you mentioned in your review Instacash funding is FREE if you choose standard delivery, which takes only 24\\-48 hours. If you need your Instacash extra fast, you can choose instant Turbo funding for $4.99 \\(or $3.99 if you have our RoarMoney bank account\\). The Turbo fee is totally optional and just helps us cover the cost of delivering your cash advance instantly when you’re in a pinch. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly: MoneyLion.com/ContactUs. ",

The only things I would change is how much intacash you can withdraw at a time and make more options for payments on your membership, loan or instacash. All of them should have instant transfer options beyond just the next pay cycle. It prevents me from paying more on my accounts in advance. Other than that this is the best debit card and financial services out.",
