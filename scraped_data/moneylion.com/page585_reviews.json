We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly. \n\nInstacash funding is FREE if you choose standard delivery, which takes only 24-48 hours. If you need your Instacash extra fast, you can choose instant Turbo funding for $4.99 (or $3.99 if you have our RoarMoney bank account).

I need a loan to pay off my credit cards from Covid, everybody says they’re going to give you $1000-$2500 but they never do. This company did not do that, they gave me exactly what they said they were going to give me, opened up A digital debit card and sent me one in the mail, and also let me invest in stocks which I actually made a little money on.

To use instant cash you can borrow in increments of $5- $50 until you reach the max they have for you. When you borrow you tip them “the amount you think is fair” with the automatic defaults tip is $5, but you can alter it to any amount including $0. However when you do select $0 you get to a screen that says you didn’t tip and it requests that you leave a tip. \nThey provide you with a card to use for instant cash and adding direct deposits, but there’s a charge of $3.99 to have the instant cash funds transferred to that card (in addition to the tip). Example- borrow $50 + $5 default tip+ $3.99 transfer to the card they provide fee. Repayment amount = $58.99)\nYou can also transfer the money to your personal debit card for $4.99. The transfer fees don’t exist if you transfer to you checking account but that takes a few business days to arrive and in an emergency you need funds quicker than that.",
