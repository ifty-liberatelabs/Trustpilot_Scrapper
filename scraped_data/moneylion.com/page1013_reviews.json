To make things easier simplify it and only make a max of 2 trans actions with one tip start ting tips out at $5 instead of $2. Just an idea.\n\nBest regards,\nSL",

Also need to have a better way to contact you if needed.  Waiting half a day to a full day to get a reply via email is a bit of a pain. Maybe be able to email to start and switch to text or give text as an option.  Can't sit around with laptop checking personal email to see if reply was made, checking personal email a lot is frowned upon by most employers.",
