I did that and still got the same error. So i delete app and reinstall... again, NOTHING. Then i have contacted support 5 freaking times and all i got was told someone will contact me in 48 hours. Never heard from anyone and still dealing with the same error. Thanks for the worst customer service ever money lion. At this point i am so BEYOND nervous that they still have access to my account after all this shadyness. So disappointed. It's also disappointing that the only reviews moneylion answers back on is positive reviews not the ones whi actually are having problems and getting crap customer service! Ridiculous.",

        "text": "This company in beyond deplorable. I am in the same situation as many others. They can certainly debit your bank account right away, but won’t post to your account for weeks. How is this fair, legal, or even ethical? To add insult to injury, we are told that we cannot borrow against our investment if our  loan is not paid off. It’s OUR money!! How can their customers be so terribly breached by their practices, and yet have to succumb to their shady dealings. They do what they want and we have no recourse—at least not a time saving or inexpensive one. They are ROBBING us, not only our money, but all of our time and our mental health. This experience is truly a lesson learned . Their advertisements mislead the public into believing that MoneyLion is the best around. Unfortunately, some advertisers and the public at large will say and print anything if they’re paid to do so. Good luck to all of us!!",

        "text": "STAY AWAY!! I started using MoneyLion/Better Cash for an installment loan. Had no issues until I opened a MoneyLion Checking Account. My first and number 1 issue is you will NEVER get to call in and speak to a live person here in the United States of America. You have go through way to many prompts that just give you information that is not needed and not true (for example their message says you can make a payment online but you cannot make a payment online unless you want to pay it off in full) get a message saying they're experience high call volume and will call you back. This is because they outsource to India and a trick to make it difficult to get information about your account. All I wanted to do is make a payment on my loan and change the account associated with my loan to the new MoneyLion checking account I opened. The rep made it very difficult to do two simple things. You need to provide better access and better customer service. I wish I knew it was this difficult to speak with someone and there is no way you can go in person anywhere to speak with anyone.",
