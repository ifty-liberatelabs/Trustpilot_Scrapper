You have to pay minimum $4 for it to be instant, even if it's being deposited into your MoneyLion Roar checking. They also say tipping is optional for this service, but they harass you multiple times for a tip, and remember next time if you didn't tip last time and harass you again. Lastly, they may offer you say $200 instacash limit, but they only let you do $50 at a time so they can collect their fees and optional tip 4 times instead of once. Pretty transparently greedy and awful.",

We designed Instacash to help you access smaller amounts of cash in a pinch, such as for an unexpected late fee or a can't-miss date night and we designed it to be easy to pay back! It isn't meant to be a way to fund your larger expenses. For these reasons, we allow you to take out InstaCash in maximum increments of $50. Of course, if you've unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You'll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time.
