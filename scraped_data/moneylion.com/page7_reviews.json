Every customer service representative was disrepesectful unhelpful uninformed and at times would completely make up things about my payment history or account until I was finally told that for some reason Moneylion marked my loan payment as an early payment for next month and the only way to solve the issue was to pay twice. I still have no had my issue resolved because all my conversations with moneylion help end with being told I’ll be transferred to someone else who will email me then the chat suddenly ends. My credit score will probably be damaged this month to a mistake moneylion made and their help staff know just as much about how moneylion works as you do\n\n(Moneylion fixed my problem right away after I posted several bad reviews.  Skip the customer care go right to the bad reviews.  I spoke with 6 people and was told no one could do anything.  Posted my review.  Someone reached out and the problem was fixed right away.)",

But then I remembered I had a credit builder loan. There was still a balance due but it was less than the $600 credit reserve set aside for me for when it was paid off and the difference would have perfectly covered the balance I owed for the rent. So i used the reserve to pay off the loan thinking I’d have the rest in my account in a few days. \n\nI was wrong. Some dumb error has kept the reserve from me because it says I have a zero balance but also that I owe $23. It won’t let me pay the $23. But I can’t access My money either.  This has been going on for long enough for me to be put out in the rain by the sheriff last night. And MoneyLion customer service despite my desperate pleas over the last few days have done N O T H I N G except tell me the “dedicated team” are on it and that they will update me. They never do. Nothing has changed. And I get the same robotic answer every time i try to talk to them. I just don’t see what would take so long to fix for such a seemingly simple error. They just don’t care at all.",

It seemed okay at first, bit to get around usary lending laws, they will loan you up to $100 until your next payday for $7 (often trying to coerce you into tipping also). They claim no interest, but that is equivalent to 7% interest in 2 weeks which is 180% interest per year. If you only need it for 3 days, Still $7 which makes it 800% interest.  That is not even the worst.\nApparently they didn't like my spending habits and froze my accounts. I had Roarmoney checking and crypto and they refuse to give my money back.  I am just starting the process of filing SEC complaints. This is my first complaint of many.  \n\nThis is communism with a social credit score.

Their customer service is excellent and attentive, but I question their security.  2 weeks ago I took an Instacash loan from them and everything went smoothly.  You have to give them your bank debit card when you sign up.  Well last Friday my bank called me to tell me my debit card number had been compromised.  Only two other accounts had it and they may also be culprits, but I'm questioning the security measures of MoneyLion based on the timing of this situation.  So I'm not saying don't use them, but just saying be careful with your information.  I have closed my account with MoneyLion and made sure they don't have my personal data.  I won't use them again.",

It will ask you for a tip, if you say no, it tries again for a second time, and you say no again.. yep you guessed it.. they ask for a THIRD time. Its sneaky the way they do it too.\nI asked a customer service rep, what the tip is for and he told me \"you wouldn't ask a waiter what his tip is for\"🤦‍♂️\nBUT WAIT.. THERE'S MORE!!\nI paid my loan payment April 30, 2023 before going into the hospital and it crossed paths with an automatic withdrawal for the same payment, which I didn't have enough to cover both.  I was told my 04/30/23 payment covered July and the 05/05/23 was late. Whaattt? So I asked for a refund on the \"July\" payment so the June payment would clear.. they said no, because they already had the money🤔 EXACTLY..THEY HAD THE MONEY🤦\nI told them that I would stop payment on the July installment, so the June would clear, which it did.. however it threw my entire profile off with Money Lion and STILL having problems 8 months later. I have an investment account that won't let me withdraw, because of fraud concerns due to the bank return.. yet they continue to take money from me to invest!? I can never get help from customer service, there is Never a supervisor available and they tell me one will call within 24 hours.. hmmmm, STILL WAITING..\nIt has been 8 months that they have not only held onto my money, but continued to take from me and it's not even invested in anything 😲\nBTW.. during this 8 months I have paid off one credit builder loan and acquired another.. so if you can figure that out, please explain it to me.",

        "text": "First....these other 5 star reviews read....so much like commercials.  Does anyone really love a banking app?  Give me a break...\nIve had this account for 3 yrs....never really had any use with it because it always says Im eligible for XYZ and at the last minute says I'm not.  \nSo heres where its shady...I decided to delete it.  Served no purpose but they had access to my accounts, so wanted it deleted.  The chatbot couldnt do it.   Customer service couldnt do it ... and when I found Account Management and selected \"delete my account\" it said my account wasn't eligible for deletion.  \nMind you, there is no negative balance.  No loans....just them connected to my real account and holding all my data.  \nYou cant delete your external account from them....so I'll likely go from my actual banks side to just block them.  \nBut ultimately...they seem more about knowing your business than performing the functions you've signed up for ... and thats just dangerous in this age of breaches and ID theft.\nI also feel it is unsavory for an App that charges fees and interests for their services .... to constantly request a Tip!  Seriously....they want to charge 9 dollars to fund an account 100 for a repayment in 2 weeks .... that's about 25% APR.  Fine...but then they have the nerve to ask for a tip?\nAfter asking for that tip ... the app randomly popped up another request for a tip in 60 seconds.  \nSo if you want to bank with a panhandler who is already making money off of you that wont let you leave and constantly is checking your wallet to see if you have cash somewhere else .... then ya .... youll love this service.\nBut back to their reviews...take note of the way they form the sentences in review after review.  English is obviously not the first language and that raises flags.  For instance .... we dont say \"Prominet Company\" in the US we say \"Reputable Company\"  .... a Prominet anything ... is \"famous\" or \"noticeable\" .... but not credible, trustworthy or reputable.  So many reviews are littered with the wrong adjectives and its just obvious Money Lion is cooking the books on their reviews.",
