Just be sure to read the screens and make your selections carefully, and you can use Instacash without tips or fees if you choose. That said, if you choose to leave a tip — thank you!\nInstacash funding is FREE if you choose standard delivery, which takes only 24-48 hours. If you need your Instacash extra fast, you can choose instant Turbo funding for $4.99 (or $3.99 if you have our RoarMoney bank account). The Turbo fee is totally optional and just helps us cover the cost of delivering your cash advance instantly when you’re in a pinch.We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly.

I was upset when the representative who took my call told me there was nothing that could be done. I posted this what was a negative review at the time in regards to that situation. Within 24 hours I was contacted by several different facets of MoneyLion to rectify this situation. Most inmortantly I was introduced to Kayala, over the last few weeks there have been several emails back and forth and too many missed calls to count. Kayala stuck  with me until ever issue was addressed and fixed. I am now currently active and able to use MoneyLion with no issues. Thank you so much for everyone who helped",
