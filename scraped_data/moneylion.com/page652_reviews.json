            "message": "Hi Joseph,\nThank you so much for taking the time to leave us a 5-star rating and positive review. To apply for Credit Builder Plus, there’s no credit check. We simply ask that you link your checking account in the MoneyLion app or dashboard so we can review it for financial and other factors. If you qualify, you’ll receive a personalized loan offer up to up to $1,000. The offer will show you how much of your loan funds you’ll get right away and how much will be saved in a Credit Reserve Account and then given to you when you’ve paid your loan in full. This is to help you save while you build credit! \n\nYour Credit Reserve Account is an interest-bearing account maintained by MoneyLion’s SEC-registered investment advisor. If you default on your loan, your Credit Reserve Account may be liquidated to partially or fully pay off what you owe. If you have any more questions regarding the Credit Reserve Account, please contact us directly. We appreciate your feedback.",

The only thing that I wish was different is the amount you can borrow at a time. I had $160 available that I could borrow but the max amount you can choose at a time is $50. If I needed to I could immediately choose to get another $50 out, and so on until the $160 available was reached. Only negative aspect is the $4.99 it charges you each time you choose to borrow money. When I borrowed $160 I ended up paying back over $179. Despite the money they tax you to borrow money its still a very useful and helpful app especially when you absolutely need money now.",

For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time.\nInstacash funding is FREE if you choose standard delivery, which takes only 24-48 hours. If you need your Instacash extra fast, you can choose instant Turbo funding for $4.99 (or $3.99 if you have our RoarMoney bank account). The Turbo fee is totally optional and just helps us cover the cost of delivering your cash advance instantly when you’re in a pinch.We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly.",
