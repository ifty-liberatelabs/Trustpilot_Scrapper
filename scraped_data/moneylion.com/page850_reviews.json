I use it when I need a little bit extra before my paycheck AND I decided to do the credit building loan they offer.. and my credit has gone up almost 100 points in just a couple months. It’s worth every penny, and on that note, it’s super affordable and they don’t try to scam you. I’m SO grateful I decided to download this app.",
