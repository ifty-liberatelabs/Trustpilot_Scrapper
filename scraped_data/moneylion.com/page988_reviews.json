And after I pay my 2nd payment this month they’ll automatically boost what I’ve already unlocked $25+ which is awesome! I’ve tried other apps like Earnin but they were too complicated to work with because of how I’m paid but because MoneyLion is also a bank I just started getting my direct deposit put in my Roar account and unlocked the InstaCash quicker than I even thought I would! Definitely recommend MoneyLion as of now and I haven’t even tried the Credit Builder feature yet which I’m sure I’ll be just as happy with.
