            "message": "We created Instacash to help you access extra money to cover everyday essentials and unexpected expenses, and we designed it easy to repay. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash advances in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in an advance of $50 at a time. \n\nInstacash funding is FREE if you choose standard delivery, which takes only 24-48 hours. If you need your Instacash extra fast, you can choose instant Turbo funding for $4.99 (or $3.99 if you have our RoarMoney bank account). The Turbo fee is totally optional and just helps us cover the cost of delivering your cash advance instantly when you’re in a pinch.\n\nTipping is optional, and whether you choose to tip doesn’t affect your eligibility in any way. Pay what you think is fair, or don't pay at all, it's up to you. Just be sure to read the screens and make your selections carefully, and you can use Instacash without tips or fees if you choose. That said, if you choose to leave a tip — thank you! It helps us cover the costs of providing 0% APR cash Instacash advances. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please contact us.",

Brigit has no fees but only lets you have $140. Solo is cool if you need more cash but suggests 7% tip to the app and 7% to the individual loaning the money.",

        "text": "This is an UPDATE to my 1st Review - I was really loving and enjoying MoneyLion until recently they temporarily suspended my RoarMoney Checking Account due to a transfer that \"I\" made. I was transferring money to a relative that was in dire need. They did this for Security reasons. I understand that but what I don't understand is why they could not be like other Banks that send you a text or email and ask \"Did you make this transaction?\" instead of immediately suspending it. I had to fax them a copy of my Driver's License and a Billing Statement showing my proof of Address. I did this a few weeks ago. The first time I emailed it to them, I found out their Customer Service gave me the incorrect Email Address. The second time I emailed it to the correct Email Address was last Tuesday, 8/24 and until today 8/30 my account is still suspended and I can't even access my own paycheck that was directly deposited on Wed, 8/25, which is very unfair. I have bills to pay and I can't pay back my InstaCash due to this and MoneyLion is saying I am late. I would not have been late if they had not suspended my account for making a transfer on it. It was me and their process is ridiculous. I was a very pleased Customer until this happened. I can't buy food or groceries, I am starving right now. Thanks MoneyLion.",
