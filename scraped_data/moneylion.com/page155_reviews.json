        "text": "It's been a bad experience overall. I don't feel MoneyLion has my financial well-being in sight. My Insta cash is keeping me in a vicious cycle. I'm on my second credit building loan without any late payments but my credit score actually went down not up.\n\nThen I was offered a promo which I made sure I did everything required on my end which is 1)be in good standing with all accounts and 2) deposit $50 into my investment account and get $50 insta cash. I made the deposit but never got the promo insta cash I talked to customer service who told me that they had forward the issue to support and that I would either receive a follow-up email with further questions or I would see the promotion of $50 in my instacash. I did receive an email from support that day and responded within 10 minutes providing them the requested information which was a screenshot of what promotion I was talking about. I never heard back from there I emailed them about 6 times with no response. Then I saw an email stating that I had to use my $50 InstaCash or it would expire I logged into the app(the website has never functioned enough to allow me to sign in) but but it said $0 into cash available. I emailed customer service three or four more times with no response. I then about 3 weeks later got an email from my direct depositor that my direct deposit have been returned from my financial institution. Then my insta cash repayment and credit building loan became in default then I received an email from customer service stating that I was not eligible for the promotion because my current accounts were in default and not in good standing as required I immediately wrote back stating that that's not the case that I wasn't good standing at the time of the promo. I didn't immediately contacted my direct depositor and they were able to reissue my direct deposit but it would take 3 to 4 days and I still have not heard back from moneylion concerning the promo.\nI had to deal with customer service several times about the website not functioning and I'm always given the same answer \"why don't you just use the app\" \nI would not suggest this financial tool as a means of budgeting saving money financial advice there's no savings account and the cost of insta cash keeps going up.",

Fast cash when you need it, for a fee or if you can just wait a day it's free. No interest due either. They only ask that idk maybe you leave a tip‽ Non profits gotta get paid so why not MoneyLion as well. If you don't feel like tipping don't, you don't have to. I do however recommend it though, kinda keeps the business in business.",
