        "text": "Instacash is pretty great they allow you to get cash immediately and allow you to boost your instacash as you pay off your request each time you get paid from your work. Only thing I don’t like is I don’t mind leaving a tip to use the service of it but the only reason I don’t is because it’s called instacash, if I were to tip I should expect the cash instantly since I’m tipping for the service but then if you tip you also have to pay the 3.99 turbo fee to get your cash right away or select the free method which could take 1-3 business days. I would tip all the time if I didn’t need it right away but the only reason I don’t is because I only use instacash for emergencies since money is tight so I can’t afford to wait. Another thing I don’t like is that I am approved for a 1,000 dollar loan but Everytime I try request it they decline me and I don’t know why when I have enough funds to cover it. But only suggestion I can make is that for instacash I think customers who pay for the membership should have access to instacash without paying a service fee since the membership is 5 dollars monthly and we most likely tip as well since we don’t have to pay an extra 3.99 which would make tipping more beneficial. I just don’t like the idea we have to pay an extra service fee when I feel like we shouldn’t. This is the only reason I’m giving it 4 stars but other then that it’s still a great provider company each company has pros and cons but I only see pros and improvement from this company so who knows in the future.",
