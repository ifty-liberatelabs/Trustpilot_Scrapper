        "text": "Been with Moneylion going on two years now, and for the most part was satisfied with their staff and services. Well that is until July 2022. There was an issue with my instacash eligibility amount. Somehow it had gotten switched to my Roar Money account instead of using my external account. Well the income difference substantial. I contacted a customer care agent and was told that he switched it back to my external account and that the insta cash eligibility amount would be corrected back to its normal amount within two business days that was July 6th well here it is August 3rd and it still has not been corrected I get a different story from every customer care agent. I was told this was escalated to their dedicated team whoever that may be more than a dozen times. I have over 24 hours of real time invested in explaining this problem and why there's a difference in the amount and the math that they keep trying to use on me. I've received 20% of my income on external account for over a year. Because of the perks of several of the different products that I use with them. At this point I give up this thing is nearly costing me my apartment as I was given this information so when moving I failed to make other arrangements to pay a electric deposit. Because I figured that the person on the line working for my financial institution knew what he was talking about. but this happened more more than one occasion with more than one agent as I said before I went through this with several different customer care agents and they were all on different page giving me different time frames and different hope to know about. I apologize for the long windedness of this review but as apparently speaking directly to a customer care agents and having an issue accelerated or escalated or prioritized whatever fails to do anything apparently. Except receive emails where they try to break down the math of why my amount is what it is based off the wrong account which was the issue in the first place. Why am I receiving which quite frankly is ignorant emails saying that basically the problem is the solution? Was thinking about moving all of my income into my Roar money account but if they cannot coordinate any better than what I have seen this month I'm a little worried about doing so. I hope this is rectified and they come back to the standard that I received for the first year and a half of doing business with them. This past month has been nothing but what I have felt like are lies and blow off tactics.",

My deposit always posts exactly when it should so I'm never left in doubt about the ability to pay my bills on time. When the unexpected happens, it is nice to have the flexibility of Instacash. And let's not forget one of the key features of having a Roar Money account, Credit Builder Plus. It really helped to improve my credit score. If it can improve mine, no one is exempt from the benefits of having a Moneylion account that ties all of these features together. I would highly recommend to all of my friends and family!",
