        "text": "BBB COMPLAINT:\n\nPROBLEM:  I contacted Moneylion via their customer service number (801-252-4427) last Friday (10/09/2020) regarding my September bank statement. I advised the customer service rep that I was applying for a loan with another company and they needed my last bank statement. I advised them that the account number on my bank statement is #4466, which is NOT the last four digits of my account with Moneylion. I advised the customer service representative of this discrepancy and was told they would email me a copy of my bank statement with the updated account number and I should receive it in 10-15 minutes. I waited 30 minutes, checked my email and there was no email so I called them back. I was then advised that it would take 24 to receive the document and it should arrive Saturday (10/10/2020). Saturday comes and still NO DOCUMENT HAS BEEN EMAILED. I give it until today 10/12/2020 and still nothing. I have called customer service twice today and both times I was placed on hold for over 10 minutes and had to hang up. My loan application was denied because I could not provide this document and this all RIDICULOUS I have been banking with Moneylion for a while now, paying monthly fees and all but I will not hesitate to close all accounts if I do not receive this document ASAP. The treatment I have received from your customer service is the worst customer service I have ever received. Either send me the document via email or forget me being a customer. I also want BBB to investigate your practices because I'm not sure how you would get a customer's account information incorrect on the last FEW bank statements  \nDESIRED RESOLUTION: Finish the Job\n\nDESIRED OUTCOME: I want what was promised to me, a copy of my September bank statement emailed to me WITH MY UPDATED ACCOUNT NUMBER ASAP\n\nDates you complained to the company/organization\n\n7.\tFirst Date:\t10/9/2020 \n8.\tSecond Date:\t10/10/2020 \n9.\tThird Date:\t10/12/2020",
