        "text": "Hello I'm a fairly new member of Money Lion and I'm here to attest this app is by far the best and most reliable consistent money lending app that I've used. I love that they take their repayment right away and there's no waiting to get your loan back of course it's in increments and you have a daily max but there have been times where I've reached my max and I'm shy 2 days til payday and I check my app and there's an additional $15 there for me to cash out. I don't know about extensions as I've never needed one but this app is the real deal and to be completely honest the app logo almost deterred me cause it looks so, I'm sorry ML but lame. I mean you think lion and I instantly think the motion pic lion maybe if it were a lion standing tall and proud from a side profile on top of a bank symbol of sorts or something more ra the logo is a misinterpretation and I almost passed them up because the logo looks shady but I'm glad I didn't.",

We created Instacash to help you access extra money to cover everyday essentials and unexpected expenses, and we designed it to be easy to pay back. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly!",
