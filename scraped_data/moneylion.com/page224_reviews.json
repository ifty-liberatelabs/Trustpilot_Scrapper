I signed up for instacash and to get paid a day early but for the past 2 months I have had to call them about my check not being deposited one day early, as advertised, they proceeded to say that they don’t see it or they do see it and it has been deposited but it’s not showing on my end. I’m just tired of the headache. Another issue is that you have to fill out an actual form if there has been theft on your account. I had an ATM not dispense $60 I needed and I called customer and they told me to send the form and it would take 2-3 weeks for them to review and possibly give a credit but nothing that could be done in real time. It’s real unfortunate because I needed that montane it wasn’t my fault it was lost.",

        "text": "I really only use this app for the instacash feature, which does work and can be helpful..but it’s misleading to say it’s interest free! The amount of money they will loan to you can only be requested in arbitrary increments. Example: when I have $300 available to borrow, I have to make 3 request in rapid succession because I’m only allowed to ask for $100 at a time (even though I can borrow $300 at a time [confusing right!] and There’s a percentage based fee on the transaction itself if you want it to happen instantly (which is almost always), so when I need $300 I will be charged $30 on top of the $300 in transaction fees; The app is very pushy with asking for a tips during the transaction and upon using the feature again later, it will remind you that you didn’t tip last time and ask for the tip AGAIN for that transaction before proceeding to the new request. Also when I stopped tipping regularly,  they changed my requestable amount to lower amounts, so that I had to make more request to get the same amount of money (therefore netting more fees for the same amount of money) they also jumbled up the request amounts in attempts to throw you off so you can accidentally select the wrong amount and (you guessed it) need to make even more request for more fee. If you fall for their design you will be paying ~25% interest on these transaction…..that being said borrow carefully and read all the prompts. It has been a helpful tool since I figure out their traps, but honestly dangerous if you don’t catch it at first",
