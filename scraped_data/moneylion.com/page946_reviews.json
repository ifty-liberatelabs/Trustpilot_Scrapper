I've talked to dozens of people on the phone, filled out two complaint forms that they sent to me on this Trust Pilot review, tried to DM on Twitter, chatted, I even requested to speak to a supervisor over a week ago all to no avail. I am going to try to find a way to close my account indefinitely now. I have reached out to the CEO but Iâ€™m assuming that will result in nothing since this is a terribly ran company. I don't even want to use them anymore at this point. This is ridiculous. \n\nIâ€™ve had an issue (stemming from MoneyLionâ€™s system) for almost 3 weeks now. Iâ€™ve spoken to almost 10 people about it. Still nothing. No one can help on Twitter, in the chat or over the phone. Iâ€™ve been given different answers from each customer service agent. For this to be a place where I spend my money, they do not care about my needs or wants. Donâ€™t use this company because if you ever need assistance, youâ€™re out of luck.",
