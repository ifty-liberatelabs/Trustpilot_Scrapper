There is always a few day lag between my automatic deposit (one account) and the account I use to pay my rent each month. My deposit always falls just a day or two after rent is due. This app has been super helpful to spot me a bit when I know I have it, but I can’t trust the time it’ll take to transfer from one account to another. Here’s my only issue: if you are approved for $100 instacash as I am (for frequent on-time repayment-) they do not send it to you in one chunk. Instead, you are “eligible” for up to $100, but it makes you request $50 at a time. This means that they are giving you the same prompts to tip, and the same prompts to choose if you’d like to pay extra for instant deposit twice. This is pretty irritating, because now I am tipping twice, and paying two instant deposit fees. I typically opt out of one tip, click past the guilt trip pop ups, (“MoneyLion doesn’t grow on trees!”) and tip a larger amount once.\n\nSo, I like MoneyLion a lot, it has certainly been super helpful for me, but I find the extra nickel and diming tedious and a little tacky.",
