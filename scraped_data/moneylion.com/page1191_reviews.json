If you have ever received a call from a telemarketer you will find there is not that much difference between them. The representatives read from a script which it just basically to provide the same information that you can read online.  The customer service reps in the chat are not help either and sending an email to the support team is hopeless. Aside from the bad customer service, the company's policy in regards to the use of your own money is not consumer friendly. If you make the mistake to get their loan, you will be paying that for a little over a year and you cannot use the money you have invested to pay off the loan. I made the mistake of getting the loan and after a couple of months of saving I had accumulated a bit over $500. I lost my job and since I had $178 left to pay on my loan, I requested that the company sells the stocks, deduct the amount owed and send me the difference. I was told no because the company policy does not allow it. What is worst, they did nothing to help increase my credit as they guaranteed. I increased my credit by 39 points by using a credit repair company. Also if you cancel your plus account, this company makes it more difficult to obtain your tax forms. If I could give a negative rating I would.",

It keeps telling me I am approved for plus and then the app or website freezes. I have tried on my phone on the app, my phone in the browser, my laptop, my work laptop, and my tablet.

        "text": "I’ve been using MoneyLion for about 7 months now. I’m paying for MoneyLion Plus which is in return helping me save. I’ve logged in for 184 days consecutively and they have not missed a payout of $1 at all. \n-I’ve seen people say that they don’t credit your loan payment sometimes and so far that has not happened to me. I’ve made 13 payments towards my loan with no issue. \n-Another Issue people seem to be having is not receiving their debit cards or receiving them late. I’ve ordered 2 cards now(since I lost my first one) and they both arrived within 5-6 days I believe. I wasn’t exactly keeping track but it definitely was not a long wait & I was pleased with the time taken. Also, people claim that they do not work and get declined. I haven’t tested to see if the card works but I will update on this once I do. \n-The MAJOR issue I see people dealing with is not being paid out  funds from their investment account after their loan has been fully paid off. Multiple people claim to have been told by Customer Support at MoneyLion that funds would arrive within a couple of days which turns into weeks and months without getting their funds. People feel hopeless because Customer support does not help in any case and basically Ignores you until you get tired of calling .  I’ve seen reviews with people calling them thieves, scammers, etc. I hope this is not the case. I’m leaving them 5 starts for now since I’ve had no issues up to this point. However, I only have 5 more months to pay off my loan and I’ve saved a pretty good amount. \nI’ve done the math and I should be able to withdraw about $500 once I pay off my loan in May . (I would have been able to withdraw $650 but MoneyLion has set a minimum of $150 which has to be in your investment account at all times.)  \n\nI will come back and update this review once my loan is fully paid off and I attempt to withdraw funds from my Investment Account to my Bank Account.   I hope to be able to withdraw my funds safe and quick and not have the misfortune that others claim to have had. If I’m not able to withdraw my funds then I’ll update here so everyone knows how MoneyLion Truly operates. \nHowever, I hope this is not the case. My experience has been A+ so far. I look forward to using them in the future. It’s so easy to take out loans and the interest is awesome. It also helps keep track of your credit. \nI’m Crossing my fingers. Will come back and update later. Thanks for reading and I hope this helps.\n\nUpdate: I originally wrote this review February 3rd. It is now May 9th..I attempted to withdraw $505 from my investment account on May 3rd and it was a simple, easy process. I did it via the app and all I had to do was provide a security code that was sent to my phone. Once I provided the code my money was withdrawn out of my investment account and today(May 9th), 6 days after withdrawing from investment account I have received the full $505 into my Wells Fargo checking account! I’m still 100% pleased with MoneyLion. Their customer support wasn’t disrespectful and answered every question I had each time I’ve called them. Although wait times can be 30 minutes sometimes which may be due to a high number of callers. I’d definitely suggest MoneyLion to anyone who is still skeptical about this service.",

Its only been a few days, but I have noticed that the website has frequent errors, probably because they need to update it for increased traffic. I have connected other bank accounts, and those have been slow to update. Some bank accounts are not able to connect to their platform. I have read reviews about the card being slow to come in the mail, I will update this review if mine takes longer than 10 days to arrive, as that is overly reasonable. I tried to use the chat option for customer service, and aside from the computerized options, I was completely ignored. There was no one available, like no one is working there. I don't plan on using this company until they improve their customer service. I can't afford to have my money trapped in a bank with no customer service to assist me with issues that may arise. That's just bad business. When I am out of debt, and able to be more risky with a little money I might come back and test it out. Hopefully their customer service improves, otherwise I really don't see this banking business working out well for them.",

        "text": "opened an account with MoneyLion a couple months ago. I still havent received my debit card. Stupid of me I switched my direct deposit to MoneyLion because the services and products offered seem to be a good benefit for me but this has got to be the worse decesion ever. Im at risk of getting evicted, losing my car, and job because I dont have access to my money because its in my MoneyLion account. I was told that it would take 7 days to receive a new card since I didnt receive my old card. I contacted customer service today because I still hadnt received my card only to be told now that it can take 17-20 days to receive because of who their delivery partnership is with and they have a high delivery request for cards which has absolutely nothing to do with me. The only thing I was offered was several apologies but at the end there is nothing they can do. Im about to loose everything and not because I dont have the money to pay for but because I was foolish enough to think that MoneyLion would be better account for me then my current. Boy was I wrong. Dont waste your time with this company they talk a good game but they do not back it up. Stick with your current financial institution at least if you dont receive your card there is still an option available for you to receive your money.\nI have a 2yrold daughter and we are both about to be sleeping outside freezing  in Phoenix Arizona someone please please help me",
