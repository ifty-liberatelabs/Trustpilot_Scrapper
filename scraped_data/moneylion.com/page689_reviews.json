So I make my instash payment for the month and then go to try and use it well my limit have been cut in half and the payment was made on the due date and was not late. So anyways it was cut in half and I couldn't figure out why well after a little research I find that there's no proof of any of my direct deposits so it was like I was a new customer again. So I call Mr Cash to try and figure out why and if they can somehow and pretty much got told that that's how it is and maybe next month well that doesn't really fix the fact that I was really kind of depending on that oh and my repayment date had gotten changed also and was two weeks from the long day instead of the normal. I have been a pretty good customer and have paid quite a bit of money in fees and tips just last month was 65 I think in fees and tips anyways I don't think that was very fair of them at all and if it was the other way around they wouldn't accept me telling them to just pretty much deal with it and I sent a complaint email and haven't heard anything yet and I'm sorry but just not at all impressed at all and will probably end up moving all my stuff to a different bank because of it so that's my thoughts on money line in insta cash",
