Repayment of the amount of Instacash you borrow is automatically deducted from your RoarMoney account or your linked external account on the due date. In order to qualify for Instacash, you must meet the eligibility requirements, which can be found on our FAQ page in the app. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions about Instacash please contact us directly.
