Has made my life easier by offering instacash , if i run short durring the month instacash is there to bail me out i dont have to ask family members for a loan to get by untill payday. Im on a fixed income and i know i need to pay the money back the difference here at money lion is 0% apr instacash even sends me extra boosts around the Holliday's EVEN boosts me just for being a part of money lion. If something happens and my payment is late because of some UNcontrollable reason they dont hound you i just let costomer service know whats going on and thats it. i have NO REGRETS i ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY MONEY LION APP AND ACCT\n            BOBBY HAINES",
