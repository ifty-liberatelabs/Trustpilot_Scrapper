        "text": "Honestly, it started out good. No interest small loans and investment account to help people build credit. The monthly membership payments at the time were put into the investment account. It the entire payment but about $50 a month and the other $20 was what you actually paid for the membership. Then they added the bank account and everything went to heck. The first bank they used was not good for the application. They changed the membership fees, none of it gets put into the investment account, the loans now have interest as does the \"instacash\" they say it's free but they badger you about \"tips\" ($3minimum) and to get it same day it costs $3.99. The loans increased from $500 to $1000 but you no longer have access to the entire loan, they give you $325 upfront and say you will get the rest after you pay the full $1k loan off. I haven't gotten a loan since they changed it but I did look into it as Christmas is around the corner and COVID-19 was not nice to our finances. Oh, you used to get $1 to your investment account every time you swiped through all the cards, that isn't a thing anymore. Instead they claim you can get up to 100% of your purchases using their shake reward thing. The truth is you get normally get less than 1% and you only earn a shake reward on certain purchases over a $ threshold. Honestly if it wasn't such a hassle to change banks and payment info I'd drop them so fast.",
