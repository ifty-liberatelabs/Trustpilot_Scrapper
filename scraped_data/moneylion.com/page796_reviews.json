I haven't had any problems. The only con is you can only borrow $50 at time and if you need $100 instantly you are going to pay $4.99 for turbo delivery plus whatever tip you decide to leave (if any) twice...BUMMER and it can add up quickly but overall MoneyLion has helped me out and I even recommend MoneyLion over Earnin!",
