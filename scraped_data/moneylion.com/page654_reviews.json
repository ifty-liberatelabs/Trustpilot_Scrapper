For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly.",

I don't have access to easily pull or put money on my card. Instacash always asks for a tip when you already make $3.99. The features compared to when you started are wack. You used to let me use credit monitor without having to pay some crazy extra fee. I used to really like you. I just use this company for the free instacash. Use and abuse it until they take it away or make it mandatory to tip. This app used to be able to be designed to help you take control of your financial well being. Now. Now its just an app to keep you down financially and stuck with then or owing credit to them. Use credit Karma!",
