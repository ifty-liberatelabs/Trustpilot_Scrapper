        "text": "My experiences have been far from good. Only one representative out of 6 that I spoke to via chat and on the phone, on different days, was actually helpful. Nobody would listen to my issue and try different steps to solve it, but instead every single one of them repeated the same things over and over, just like the rep before them. Regardless of me telling them that I had already been through the steps they were recommending to try and solve my problem, they all basically told me that what they were saying was the only solution they had and I would just have to wait 3-5 business days to see results. Well, I waited 3-5 business day each time like they said, adding up to almost 2 months, and nothing was ever fixed, requiring me to call back or chat with them.again for hours, just to go through the same stuff over again. Finally, after all this waisted time, I was finally lucky enough to speak to somebody who wasn't reading off of a script, and he was able to resolve my issue, putting an end to all of my problems. Although I love this account and all the great benefits it offers, my experiences with customer service has made me question whether or not to keep my accounts open or not. Also their app has a bunch of glitches and problems , making it hard to actually do anything other than just check my balances each day......which takes much longer than it should. To sum it up, their customer service reps are rude and not helpful at all, the app is slow, times out constantly, fails to save changes in account information , (adding debit cards, editing payment accounts/methods, adding bank accounts/cards, and linking external accounts from other banks), and1 transfers take much longer to process than their guaranteed funding time of 3-5 business days. Also, when your bi-weekly payments for your investment account fail to process because of the app not saving your new bank card information, they will freeze your accounts and your debit card so you cannot access your money until they are able to link your new bank and set up the new card for your payments. This could take a long time.....if you read this entire review you will see that it took about 2 months to fix mine.",
