Still learning but the amount of fees I’ve paid with BofA is over 1k in a years time!! The offer overdraft but to still charge you fees when transferring money from Savings to checking... Fees for minimum balance requirements, fees for checks, fees for everything! I just couldn’t do it anymore! So I made the switch. At least temporarily and eventually will go with a credit union. But working on cleaning up credit etc first. Save up money not to have my bank charge fees to take it all away. \n\nGive it a shot!!",
