The way they break up the instacash into increments I believe is just a way to get you to pay extra fees. I only signed up with them with the intent to get the credit builder loan and I didn’t get that so I probably won’t be using them again.",

For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly. \n",
