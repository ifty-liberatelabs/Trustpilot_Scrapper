            "message": "Hi Jodi, The amount of Instacash you are eligible to receive is based on a variety of factors, including your MoneyLion account history, deposit and spending activity, repayment history, and other risk-based factors, as determined by MoneyLion in its sole discretion, and may change from time to time. Therefore, demonstrating consistent direct deposits and on-time payments can increase your Instacash eligibility, while a negative change in these factors could lower your Instacash eligibility. \n\nOne of the best ways to ensure higher amounts of Instacash is connecting your direct deposits to a RoarMoney account. The same direct deposit when detected in RoarMoney (vs. an external bank account) will unlock TWICE the Instacash. You will always be informed of your current available Instacash amount in the MoneyLion mobile app. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please contact us.",

        "text": "I was scammed by a fake moneylion account on Instagram and am being targeted by more like it, on top of that moneylion charged me twice and is not only refusing to give it back but they're trying to hold me responsible even tho I have proof of this and now they've locked me out of my moneylion account! Also even tho I was being as civil as I could be one of their customer support agents just hung up on me! I'm beyond upset, I'm homeless and live in a women's shelter in Portland and I've been thru hell I don't need this! Moneylion you are crooks!.... ² So it just takes a bad review to get your attention? Why didn't you just say so? Ok, first of all victim shaming is not only SUPER classy but professional as well! And u now suggest I reach out thru your social media for help? You've GOT to be f**king joking right? Ok sure, which one of your Instagram accounts should I try, there's only 40 or 50 at least? Should I try messaging the one where \"moneylion\" claims I've won $2021 or should I try the one that called me a goat and said such vulgarity it should belong in a porn mag? I take responsibility for being naive and not thinking on this one but with as many fake profiles these ppl have made I know this can't be the first you've heard of this and there's got 2 b more victims.Also i DID reach out to both you & Instagram to get help with this but nothing! There's no such thing as REAL live support anymore! I had always paid back apps on time and was hoping to raise my credit score so that I could put a roof over my head and get my mom and I an apartment together but instead I've had to borrow again right after paying them all back just to pay all the motels I've had to stay bcuz I had nowhere 2 go and bcuz the shelters here in Portland are overloaded unless I wanted to pitch a tent out here downtown and there's just so many of the mentally ill homeless that no one cares about one more, there was just no help just like now, there's only greed and blaming and pretty much just \"oh well you're screwed lady hope u learned your lesson!\" I've been so stressed I lost my hair and am now super thin and was in fear of being less than a day away from the streets where it's more like an insane asylum for ppl who took too many drugs and now this bs? Yeah I was gullible and desperate but the links and messages looked pretty legit just like the real Moneylion so they did their homework,guess i shoulda just did mine or at least remembered to change my login info immediately but I didn't, so in a nutshell moneylion are you saying that I deserved this? Let me know and in the meantime I hope that $205 that you wrongfully took from me is doing more for you than it could've for me since I've been broke since before I even woke up on payday, without a damn cigarette to calm me down or unable to buy food when I work late and miss dinner at the women's shelter, no, not a bunch of made up bs this is %100 truth and idk how hard you have to work for your $ but I'm a housekeeper at a residential home for the disabled so what I do IS  hard work therefore I shouldn't have had to beg you for my own money back or my bank to hurry up with their \"provisional\" money that I still have yet to receive or for you to at least let me get an Instacash loan that someone else got to cash in on from MY loyalty and on time payments that I earned! It's almost like you're siding WITH the bad guys,except to me you're one of them also! And great customer service btw,speaking of your rep just hanging up on me for being angry yet in a civil manor demanding answers? And because I had to change my debit card,now all my other payday apps have encountered more bugs they need to fix,they all started me over even tho my accounts still the same and charging me  new member fees again so I was looking at a $10 advance from other apps I use like DAVE when used to be $100! God Bless the good ppl from Earnin, they're truly #1! They are always so quick 2 help and fix my issues, they raised my max rather than decrease it like Cleo, Dave and KLOVER who just snatched up the $10  i had borrowed and b4 I even got across street to buy lunch at work it was gone and wasn't even due till TOMORROW! trust them folks to ever get your payback date correct EVERYTIME, double check! Am I bitter? Yes, do I sound a little bit like someone who's snapped? Yup! U would too if you've been in my shoes not to mention that my bank Rivermark CCU who has done everything they can to assure they get at least 1 to 2 $30 overdraft fees outta me each pay period even when the apps have a different post date they push em on thru anyways so that they can charge me for it which in hence is making me look irresponsible and likely to keep me and mom homeless even longer so thanks for the HELP Moneylion,Instagram,Rivermark! You got my referrals! 👍_In Instagram Type moneylion in searchbar to 👀 and I got screenshots to prove it all if anyone's interested in helping me stop them!",
