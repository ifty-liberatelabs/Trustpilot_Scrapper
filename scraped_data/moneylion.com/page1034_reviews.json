Money lion's instacash, when used responsibly, can get you out of a tight spot when you're a couple of dollars short until payday. \n\nI have one issue with instacash though. No matter how much you have available, you can only take $50 increments. Which is understandable. However, they ask that you leave an optional tip each time, and charge a $4 fee if you need it instantly. So if you need $100, you'll pay 2 instant transfer fees and if you don't leave a tip on one of them (even if the first one had a tip) you'll receive a guilt trip message until you give in and add an additional tip.",
