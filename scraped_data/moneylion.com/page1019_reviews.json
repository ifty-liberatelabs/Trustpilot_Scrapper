It has been a wonderful relationship. Then they came out with Instacash.\n\nInstacash is very convenient but they charge you $4.99 to get the money immediately or free to wait 3 days, then also want you to leave a tip on top of it. If I'm borrowing money, I'm pretty sure I can't afford to pay back the extra $4.99 with an extra tip on top. \nThen if you're borrowing for an emergency like rent or something and need a larger amount you have to do it multiple times since you can only take out $50 at a time. So then the vicious circle begins of needing to repeat borrow. \n\n**UPDATE  They did contact me. My issue was already resolved, but they were very helpful about the circumstances. Unfortunately this is the way it works and you just have to be careful not to take more than you can afford to pay back like I did.",
