Just wondering why if im in default for a 500$ secure loan with  200$ HOLD then why am I being charged for 519$ the whole amount. Also explain to me why your responsible for my account being broken into and drained while we were talking about it. This company is trash, Ive already filed with the FBI for Identity theft because of MoneyLion Inc, and I hope no one needs to do the same....STAY AWAY FROM THEM",

The highest increment available is 50.00 so if you're eligible for say 400.00 you have to take eight 50.00 advances at 4.99 ea to get the advance with turbo. People should be able to get a single advance for whatever amount they're eligible for. This \"glitch\" is why I seldom give a tip.",

            "message": "We created Instacash to help you access extra money to cover everyday essentials and unexpected expenses, and we designed it easy to repay. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time. \nInstacash funding is FREE if you choose standard delivery, which takes only 24-48 hours. If you need your Instacash extra fast, you can choose instant Turbo funding for $4.99 (or $3.99 if you have our RoarMoney bank account). The Turbo fee is totally optional and just helps us cover the cost of delivering your cash advance instantly when you’re in a pinch.We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly.",
