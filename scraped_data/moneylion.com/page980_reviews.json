It doesn’t help that my job refuses to do direct deposit so I’m automatically cut from 90 percent of the awesome stuff that attracted me here in the first place. That and it’s not possible to add this account to an external, you have to add the external to this account. Which is very limiting on what is already extremely limited experience for me as it is. So bah, 3 Stars. Totally could be 5 Stars if I came from money. But I don’t, I come from the bottom and MoneyRoar whatever Lion does it’s job keeping the bottom where we belong. Right MoneyLion?",

You cannot request a replacement physical card on the app, the directions given by you guys takes you in a stupid loop. You can only replace a virtual card which is ridiculous, since you can’t lose a virtual card, but you can freeze it. Simple little kinks such as the one explained are everywhere. Makes customers frustrated, and not trust this financial institution, Ask your self if you don’t have quality review accuracy on your website maybe it’s the same way with the money ‘we’ as customers deposit. Customer service is horrible, idk how I stayed with money lion for 2 years. Gladly I use discover as my bank, but have this as a back up. Sadly Yaoundé guys had great potential to have millions of customers, but as I stayed, small issues persisted, and can’t complain to anyone without having a 30-45 min hold for a foreign broken English representative that can’t even resolve the issue .",

            "message": "Hi there, Samantha. Thank you so much for this awesome 5-star review! We're happy to know that our 0% APR InstaCash was able to provide assistance to you! Additionally, we designed Instacash to help you access smaller amounts of cash in a pinch, such as for an unexpected late fee or a can't-miss date night and we designed it to be easy to pay back! It isn't meant to be a way to fund your larger expenses. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in maximum increments of $50. We appreciate your feedback regarding InstaCash so that we can continue to improve our products and services. It’s members like you that help make MoneyLion ROAR! Given you’ve expressed a positive experience with MoneyLion, would you be open to also sharing this review on other review sites, including Google Play, Apple Store, BBB, and Wallethub? Thanks again for being the best part of MoneyLion!",
