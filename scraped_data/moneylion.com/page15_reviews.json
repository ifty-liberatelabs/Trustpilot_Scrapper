They invested a dollar everyday you signed into the app. And used it toward your membership fee. \nNow the credit builder plus has a glitch. If you want to use it do not set your direct deposit up with the Roar Money account. The senior management said you have to have a external account for the credit builder loan. \nSo the Roar Money account that Moneylion offers is not good enough for the underwriters to give you the loan. \nDirect Deposits take over 2 months to be recognized on your insta cash option also. \nThe investing portfolio is amazing and the shake and bank rewards do help keep your financial goals growing. I would recommend this as a secondary bank and not a primary since their own account is not good enough for their own credit builder",

        "text": "This is a user-beware complaint. I set up a MoneyLion account to check out their services. When I reached out to the company, which was less than a week into opening the account, I was told they could deactivate my account but could not delete it or my information, which makes no sense. I then asked well what additional steps could be taken to complete the deletion of all my data. I was told there was non. I then requested an email to confirm the deletion of the account because they offered no confirmation of this. I was put on hold and was sent an email that is attached. When the representative returned to the line, I asked her, I am currently on the app, and the button in the app clearly stated to delete the account, not deactivate it. Her response was only people residing in California could entirely delete their account, which is a significant miss representation as there is nothing in the app that says that, and the button and prompts are clear to delete, not deactivate.\n\nBeware this company is basically stealing your information and will not fully delete your account which can lead to major leaks of your information to third parties.",
