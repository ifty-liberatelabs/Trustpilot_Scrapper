        "text": "I do not recommend this company. Currently it has been 8 business days - almost 2 weeks that my account has been closed by their error due to my direct deposit from my job triggering the account to be closed. I have over $3000 frozen in the account, have been able to pay rent and was unable to pay for our thanksgiving meal. My experience with them has been awful. I’ve called 5 times and emailed 3 providing all information they have asked for with no new information. I was my account would be open in 1-2 business days after sending in verification information.  Ive heard no updates.  Their retention team is not responsive and you will be left vulnerable. Their direct deposit does not enable you to get your check 2 days early. That’s a lie and it’s never happened. Please save yourself and do not use their direct deposit and do not use this as your main debit card. You could get stuck like me. They are good for getting you out of a bind with the roar money loans but not have me in a terrible bind financially. I’m posting this everywhere hoping I will finally get an update. For those in the same boat, I encourage you do the same.",
