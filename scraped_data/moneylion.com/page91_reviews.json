        "text": "This is the absolute worst company I have ever had the displeasure of opening an account with. To even call it a bank account is bad on my part. I recently opened a money lion card as my options for brick and mortar banks at the moment are limited for reasons I don’t care to get into. That being said I solely rely on money lion for my banking and everyday purchases such as paying bills, buying my daughter food clothing the daily essentials etc etc. Since opening the account for the better half of about 2 weeks, I’ve had over 3 thousand dollars deposited into my money lion account via cash out from PayPal. Never once had an issue. Made purchases daily and even made major purchases with the account including my rent which is around 1400 dollars give or take. Again never having issues with any of that stuff that is until early yesterday afternoon where I received an email stating my account had been locked due to fraudulent activity. Never was a fraudulent charge on my account and if that was the case, I would have most certainly contacted money lion or meta bank on that matter. To cut to the chase, I basically got that issue resolved after hours of aggravating phone calls to foreign representatives who clearly show no sympathy or understanding of how hindering these situations can be. This morning I was unfortunately met with the same issue as the day before except this time my account was apparently closed with 508 dollars still on my account. Tried numerous times to call money lion and nobody is any help. Surprise surprise right? Anyway, upon calling multiple numbers trying to get a hold of someone who could explain to me at the very least on what’s going on I was met with generic pre scripted answers that had little to nothing to do with my specific situation. I did nothing other than use my money lion card and account for your everyday needs, even read the terms of service to make sure I didn’t step out if line and after reading it 3 times over I knew I had done nothing wrong and it was money lion scamming me for 508 dollars. It’s beyond me how a company closes your account and doesn’t let you withdraw funds. Literally the only source of money I had was on here and now I’m in a frenzy trying to situate a mess I didn’t create. If anyone out there has a resolution to this please let me know because I feel so helpless at the moment. I’m looking into hiring an attorney just because I don’t see anywhere else to turn.",

        "text": "DO NOT TRUST!!! It was good until I disputed $1600 that was fraudulently taken through debit card transactions. I was never alerted, despite having alerts active. Money lion closed my account and locked me out. Said that I violated their agreement. I asked how?? They can't tell me. I asked for my remaining balance but was told that they would \"ATTEMPT\" return to originator. I supplied the information of the original account in my name but they said they won't return it, it will sit in escheatment for 3 to 5 years... Here are some off my emails as facts: \nHello James,\n\nThis is ***reaching out to you with MoneyLion's Customer Advocacy Team in regards to your received complaint. We thank you for allowing us the opportunity to resolve your concerns!\n\nYour account was escalated to me and I was advised that you were looking to reopen your RoarMoney account. As a summary of our findings, effective 4/04/2022, the RoarMoney account has been closed due to violations of our membership agreement.\n\nAfter reviewing your concerns, MoneyLion respectfully declines your request to reopen the account in question. We truly apologize for the inconvenience and frustration that this may cause. We will attempt to return to the originator or it will go into escheatment depending on the state which can take 3-5 years.\n\nAs this is our final determination, please feel free to reach back out to me with any questions you have on your account or the resolution provided and I'd be happy to reopen your case to help out how I can!\n\nBest Regards,\n***\nMoneyLion Customer Advocate\n\nDear ***.\nThank you for your email. The originator of the funds is cash app. I have all documentation from them that I will be sending you. You already have the information in your system.\nI have already attempted to have MY Funds returned to cash app. However, I am locked out of the money lion account. Kindly return MY money to the originator. Here is the information\nIn response from cash app:\nSince we’re unable to reverse this payment, we need the bank’s help in locating these funds for you. Please provide the following to your bank’s branch manager or debit operations team.\n\nDeposit Amount: note: (I had to remove personal info on this review)\n\nBank Name: METABANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATIO\nYour time is appreciated.\n P.s, \n     Thankfully, I did not want to reopen my money lion account. I just want my money back.ASAP\nHello James,\n\nI am checking on this to see if the funds can be returned back to Cash App. If they cannot, it will go into escheatment depending on the state which can take 3-5 years. Once I receive an update, I will be following up with you.\n\nIn the meantime, if you have any questions regarding your complaint, you may respond to this email and I would be more than happy to assist.\n\n\nBest Regards,\n****\nMoneyLion Customer Advocate\n\nMoneyLion Customer Care\nHello James,\n\nUnfortunately, we are unable to return the funds to Cash App. I do apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. It does appear it will go into escheatment depending on the state which can take 3-5 years.\n\nYour account had been closed in accordance with our membership agreement. Unfortunately, that is all the information we have at this time. If you have further questions, you may refer back to your membership agreement.\n\n\nBest Regards,\n*****\nMoneyLion Customer Advocate\n\nMoneyLion Customer care is a joke. They can't help and have pre arranged answers. God forbid if I was relying on my money they have to live and survive on....  BEWARE of the LION.,... Don't trust these people. Ranks of pure SCAM with their unethical practices.\nI asked one question from money lion. Why can't you return my money???? I did not abandon my account per laws of escheatment. Why can't they answer my question??  They have my bank information. They know who the originator is. Yet, they ask that I remove personal information from this review. I don't have anything to hide. They do....no transparency. No answers...I'm not someone who judges but what they do is  wrong. A legitimate banking institution will not deliberately try to keep your money from you. Do not put your money in money lion unless you can afford to lose it. My experience is real and not biased. I actually liked money lion until they screwed me over and now I know they can't be trusted. I have yet been able to speak with someone from money lion who can answer my questions. \n Banks are supposed to be trusted with our money. BEWARE of the roaring lion, they will devour your assets...",

WELL THEY ARE holding ssa deposits until Sunday the 1st  while all other early deposit banks and cards posted deposits today the 29th. They gave me a reason that was how there system works so my deposit is with the and they will hold it until 2 days prior to the 3rd no matter what holiday or weekend. MONEYLION FIRST LIE AND DOWNALL HOLDING PEOPLE MONEY 2DAYS LONGER THAN all other early pay deposits banks with no real concrete reasons to offer  They lie by saying the don't hold your money and post as soon as received. You are put on shame wall for this big lie false advertising 😒.  Now they do have other great tools associated with the lion and so far those get A+ from me.",

You name it I have it but when reaching out to cs they just said sorry cant help you or tell you why it declined it or how to fix it nor do we accept any resubmission of id on chat its just ridiculous to me that I have a valid id and am willing to provide a ton of proof and they wont even anser emails and chat people are not helpful at all they wont do anything they wont tell me anything and are rude. Moneylion has become another one of those money apps that just dont care about customers especially honest ones just trying to get by that are who they say they are i am really sad over all this.",
