        "text": "I have opportunity to pay off debt, instead of wasting the money, remain depressed in a viscous cycle paying back $250 per month for 2 years maintaining 400 FICA score to brandish statistics.\nEleminating credit delinquencies steadily on time works.  $20 per month allocated 12 directions, is the key.  If you don't notice it's gone, you work with what you've got.  \nPlease give me a chance to prove my knowledge and expertise in improving my own credit.  The money I would spend with credit repair agencies per account, could be used to eliminate debt fast, final.  I know I can do this.  I will work at 1 year increments attacking the installment accounts first and in the next year after complete repayment to lenders , afford to take higher loan but with satisfactory credit approval rating, lower interest. I'm doing this on my on, on a fixed income, in the fashion most operable, financially secure, and producing the best results with the least amount of expenditures. COVID ruined me and I'm fighting back.  I will not spend more than what it will take to satisfy each individual creditor.  I will not pay anyone to work on my behalf because I can do what they do and keep the checks and balances flat while during repayment of my debt.  I have suffered thousands of dollars at the hands of stealthy credit repair agencies, only salvaging one or two critical improvements.  I refuse to file bankruptcy; I don't owe that much.  Credit repair agencies often take your $400 credit card bill, negotiate its increasing amount down to penny's on the dollar, with my monthly payments exacted in swift instant negotiated payoffs, however the results remain on my report as paid in full at lesser amount for continued 7 to 10 years.( point do increase).  I can argue the same proposal and get it done instantly, instead of 6 months of monthly regulatory payments to the repair agency along side their racked up maintenance fees per account($100+).  This procedure simply raises your amount due back to its original amount undisputed but the credit repair agency gets rich making you believe that every penny is going towards your total pay down amount.  In actuality, you are making huge often 2 - 3 hundred dollar monthly payments on only 6 or 7 of your smaller debt payments at a pace of 1 account every 3 months.  I can get it done in 7 months, 12 accounts completely absolved, as paid in full for under $1500 DOLLARS.  ALL I need is for someone to believe in me and stop trying to sell me a dream of perfect credit in three years on a total of $5000 dollars.  I can pay off a car in two years for that much.  Why not total debt.  Even with my current delinquencies, I have managed to improve my FICA with the three bureaus, LEXISNEXIS, and CHEXSYSTEMS..  MY JUDGEMENT ON LEXISNEXIS has been updated to paid in full.  Credit repair agencies claimed it couldn't be done.  I did it and for half the court fees, legal fees, and any late charges were dropped lowering my total to $1640 from $3450.  MY EVICTION was for one month unpaid on the 12th month of the lease only owing $445 plus $75 late fee.  Discrimination(Alabama), price-gauging, ruthless judicial practices = NO WIN.  Now, I have mastered the game and will see a 700 FICA score by June 2021, still pending challenges to tackle.  But with 700 score and only medical bills above $1000 or more, my beautiful Bank, Wells Fargo introduced me to BILLPAY.  8 BILLPAY accounts set up for 2 years at surgical repayment increments relentlessly, in knowingly(forgotton) leaving one set amount to live on while spontaneous, on time, affordable repayment checks issued to each creditor on behalf of my medical providers. No medical bills will incur, because I won't make them.  I have had to dedicate, completely restructure, my way of life.  No ATM fees, overdrafts, monthly shopping sprees, credit traps, subscriptions, expenditures.  Just food, rent\npet care.  I will ask all credible lenders.  One Will Answer.  I won't give up.  I am a good person",

We created Instacash to help you access extra money to cover everyday essentials and unexpected expenses, and we designed it to be easy to pay back. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time. Tipping is optional, and whether you choose to tip doesn’t affect your eligibility in any way. Pay what you think is fair, or don't pay at all, it's up to you. Just be sure to read the screens and make your selections carefully, and you can use Instacash without tips or fees if you choose. That said, if you choose to leave a tip — thank you! It helps us cover the costs of providing 0% APR cash advance to many, many folks like you! We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly!",
