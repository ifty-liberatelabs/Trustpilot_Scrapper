        "text": "I used to like Moneylion and the products it offers but I’m am ending my relationship with this company due to false advertising and useless customer support. Moneylion use early direct deposit as a way to lure customers, but don’t rely on it. It was great for a while until it didn’t come one day, and I received 10 different answers about why and was told to just keep checking my account. The day of my actual payday, when anyone would expect funds to arrive overnight or at least the morning, I never received the deposit. I called Moneylion and was told to “be patient” and that the funds would arrive within the day. That never happened. In the evening I contacted customer support again, and then was told that it could arrive on in the evening, but it could be the weekend, and to call back if I didn’t see it on Saturday. My interpretation of their response “yes, we received the funds from your employer, but we are holding it for no reason and we cannot tell you why or when you will receive it, sorry!” Their customer support representatives are no help and honestly a waste of your time. Their complaint form is also a waste of time; I never received a response. If you need an alternative financial institution to traditional banks, look elsewhere. 0 compassion or understanding of who their target customers are or and their needs. Their customer support responds quickly but what does that matter if no one can offer real answers or actual support.",
