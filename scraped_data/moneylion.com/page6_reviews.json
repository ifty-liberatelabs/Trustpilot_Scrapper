They reported my account as delinquent without ever attempting to contact me to resolve. They indicated they attempted to do so \"multiple times\" but I can prove that is a lie and will be doing so in small claims court. The amount they are claiming was delinquent was around $142.00. Yes, that is right, Moneylion was reporting me delinquent on an account that THEY owed ME $8.00 on. Absolutely disgusting behavior from a criminal enterprise and glorified racketeering scheme.",

        "text": "I want to start by saying this is great app. It‚Äôs easy to use and it‚Äôs quite engaging. A lot of benefits offered but beware and hopefully my experience can help others here. I downloaded this app due to the early direct deposit they offer. Previously, I had my Bank of America account connected to Moneylion so I can access the instacash feature. Instacash feature is like an advance or like a loan that you would have to pay at the set date. Anyway, I used to get about $600 in instacash limit. Then, suddenly, I noticed that my limit has been decreasing even with the boost coming from other people. Looking at one of their service offer was increased the instacash limit to up to $1000 if you have your direct deposit transferred. Well, that‚Äôs what I did and my direct deposit hit today at Moneylion. I paid my previous balance and I‚Äôve been always on time on my payments. I noticed my instacash limit decreased significantly from $600 to $85 like WTH? I contacted customer support and was able to chat with Alexis T. She informed me that the increase in instacash limit is after 2-3 direct deposits. I was like where was that shown in the offer? So, that‚Äôs done and I don‚Äôt think I can do anything about it. So I inquired about my significant decreased in instacash limit and she informed me that it‚Äôs due to Moneylion did not detect any direct deposit in my previously connected bank. No duh, I just moved my direct deposit to Moneylion. I asked why can‚Äôt Moneylion detect my newly direct deposit in my Moneylion account and she just told me that it will not detect until 2-3 deposits. Like seriously??? Anyone thinking of transferring here to Moneylion, please be ready and do your preparation. Definitely got screwed this time. \n\nUpdate: 03/06/2024 it‚Äôs been 48 hours since I spoke with a representative like they responded. Still no solution. All they told me that instacash is not detecting my recent direct deposit and that they escalated the problem to an engineer ( God knows who). Been following up daily and no result. Since my query was posted on 02/28/2024, that means I‚Äôve been waiting for a week for a solution. Such a disappointment. ",

If you barrow the max the let you select at one time $100 they charge an $8.99 fee.

        "text": "I recently transitioned my banking to MoneyLion, hoping to leverage their services to enhance my credit score, a challenge for a young entrepreneur with a limited credit history. My decision to switch was further influenced by my husband's positive experiences with their platform. Yet, my journey with MoneyLion has morphed into a harrowing ordeal that now threatens the very survival of my business. \n\nThe nightmare began with the freezing of my account following a standard $4,000 deposit from a domestic client, a transaction that should have been routine but has inexplicably put my ability to pay bills and even feed my children at risk.\n\nIn my search for answers, I encountered an almost non-existent customer service system. The representatives I spoke with offered nothing but hollow, rehearsed lines devoid of empathy or understanding. Their indifference has been nothing short of terrifying. I've spent the day oscillating between bouts of crying and futile attempts to communicate with MoneyLion's team, culminating in a staggering six hours of calls, chats, and emails, ending in abrupt disconnections and no resolution.\n\nAfter being informed of the need to verify my identity, I promptly submitted the required documents: a copy of my ID, a recent utility bill, and a photograph of myself holding my identification. Instead of resolving the issue, each submission was met with a new, seemingly arbitrary critique‚Äîthe photo didn't show my shoulders, the image wasn't zoomable, and my face didn't match because I wasn't wearing my glasses. The scrutiny intensified with conflicting information regarding my business and residential addresses.\n\nEach representative I spoke with seemed to have a different story about what it would take to regain access to my account. Yet the message was always the same: an apology followed by their inability to assist. Requests to speak with supervisors or specialized departments led nowhere.\nMy diligence in following their every direction has led to nothing but frustration. \n\nI'm left with a business at risk, employees reluctant to work for me, and the looming specter of late fees on unpaid bills. The fear of never regaining access to my funds, a fear fueled by similar stories uncovered during desperate research, is overwhelming. This entire experience has left me feeling ill, on the edge of a breakdown, and without hope. Having my account access revoked after providing all the requested information seems unjust and downright fraudulent.\n\nAs I write this, I am distraught, scared, sick with worry, and seething with anger. There was no fraud on my account, only the actions of a company that has now become a roadblock to my financial well-being and peace of mind. I cannot fathom how a company can justify such treatment of a customer. My situation is dire, and I implore anyone who reads this to understand the severity of MoneyLion's actions and their devastating impact on real lives.\n\n*UPDATE - NOW MONEY LION WANTS A PHOTO OF MY SOCIAL SECURITY CARD!!!\n\nI am at my wits' end with Money Lion's relentless invasion of my privacy and their unfounded refusal to grant me access to my own account and funds. It's a harrowing ordeal to watch helplessly as gatekeepers of my financial lifeline demand piece after piece of personal information, with no end in sight. With every new request, it feels less like a security measure and more like an unwarranted interrogation, leaving me to question the safety and privacy of my most sensitive information. Their denial of direct communication with a fraud department, a department that should be at the forefront of resolving such issues only amplifies my distress. It's maddening and deeply concerning that MoneyLion is holding my money hostage, effectively paralyzing my business and personal life. This is not just poor customer service; it's a blatant disregard for customer rights and a breach of the trust I placed in a financial institution that promised to act in my best interest.\n\nMONEYLION'S NEW RESPONSE\n\nReply from MoneyLion\n\nAn hour ago\nWe see your frustration, and we want to ensure this matter is full addressed. We were able to confirm that one of our dedicated customer advocates is diligently working through your concern. Thanks.\n\nYou absolutely are not working on anything. Nobody has been any help at all. Your dedicated customer advocate closed my account and MoneyLion is stealing my money. That's how MoneyLion has decided to \"help\" me.",
