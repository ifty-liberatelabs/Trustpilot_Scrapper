        "text": "With the Covid19 affecting my monthly financial obligations, it has been difficult to get from paycheck to paycheck without missing a payment or paying but past the due date... In my case, I get paid once a month. Without Covid19,  maintaining a budget for 30 days is a challenge. With Covid, I wouldn't be able to make it without MoneyLion and the Instacash service they offer. With it being 0.00% I am able to turn my hard to manage paid once a month situation into a very manageable one. It's like I'm getting a second paycheck deposit instead of just one. And greatly saves in Late Fees, and negative marks on credit report and credit score for missed and paying late. One last remark on how instacash saved me from a disastrous and embarrassing situation. Im at the checkout with a cart full of groceries and household supplies. Of course there is a long line of customers with their full carts waiting for me to make my purchase and keep the line moving... My cart total was something like $250 and card was declined... i only had $180.. With my smartphone and MoneyLion Instacash in under a minute money was transferred, $250 paid, and those customers behind me didn't realize the additional waiting time that had been avoided as i would have had to go through the items and decide which i could remove from cart and bring total below $180...",
