It’s included in the membership.\n\nMembership dues are due bi weekly 9.20 every 2 weeks unless a certain criteria is met\n\nLoan products are traps if you sign up with a loan with them you are stuck in a financial prison and can’t cancel your membership until it’s been paid off. \n\nI’ve been trying to cancel my membership. I’ve paid off all my loans but the payment status still haven’t been posted it’s been weeks.  They are doing this on purpose so that they can milk for membership fees. \n\nDon’t sign up for this company they are greedy people and you will regret it.\nI didn’t believe the one star reviews at first but yes!

Now, days later, I have made several attempts of reaching customer service by phone, opening tickets via email, dms on Facebook, callback requests and my issue is still not resolved. Calling only results in excessively long wait times with the auto system eventually forcing a callback request.  I've never received a callback. 1 generic auto response to a email. No response at all to the others. No response at all to my DM. I've since noticed my membership payment has been pending over 7 days. This is a bit excessive and I'm wondering why so long this time? Also an unauthorized charge in NY. I've been unable to report it, due to customer service  being nonexistent. Moneylion is making it extremely hard to even want to even use their services.",

I gave you step by step instructions, because it seems that no one with this company pays attention. \n\nI'm so frustrated, I'm filing a report with BBB, as well as contacting my attorney to start drafting documents to cease all withdraws from our account.  \n\nUghhhh...It should not take hours and days to speak to someone about my money!!!!",

        "text": "Would avoid this company like the plague. A number of reasons. Mostly due to the lack of customer service and ineffective app. Timeline follows:\nI started in March of 2019. Created an account. Took a $500 loan. was going well until September of 2019.\nSept 2019- Wanted to pay off an Instacash loan. Used my debit card. App said it failed twice. I submitted a third time, and was successful. When I checked my bank account the next day, Moneylion had debited  my account three times.\nTried to contact customer service via telephone. Placed 15 calls over the course of a day. Was told to press 2, they'll call me back. Two days later, never received a call. Finally got hold of a human after sitting on hold for one hour. Mind you this was the 4th call that day, on hold for one half hour, then being disconnected each time. \nBTW, I tried to use the dispute function on the app. Only to have the dispute closed both times, without being contacted. \nWhen speaking to this agent, he said he would personally escalate my issue. Asked me to send screenshots of my bank account. Which I did, immediately following the call. I hear nothing for one week. The agent then contacted me, asking if I uploaded the screenshots. I answered yes. Thirty minutes later, I receive an email stating the dispute had been closed for non-response. I'm still out $100. I then call and sit on the phone for an hour. I speak with someone. Tell them I want to pay off my loan, and close my account. This was on September 20 or so. They could not set up a payment over the phone, for some BS reason. Told me to use the app, which had not functioned for several days. Told me to delete and reload the app, which I had already done. Then he asks me to set up a transfer on my bank's end, which would involve a transfer charge. Angry, I hung up. On Sept 25, 2019, I was finally able to set  up the final payment on the app. The money was withdrawn from my bank on Sept 26. The same day, I sent an email revoking their authorization, to take any further membership payments. I used the stupid, poor functioning app to cancel my membership as well. On Sept 30, they took $9.99. Back to the loan payoff. The app stated the payment would clear on Sept 30, then I could withdraw my investment account. Here we are on October 2, still not showing that they have received my payment. And here I am on hold again, for 33 minutes, so far. Again this is after being hung up on about 10 times. Going to my bank to stop future drafts by MoneyLion. Will cost me $33.00 per attempt, but I'd rather lose that money, the give this shady operation another penny. I am also filing a complaint with the BBB and my state Attorney General.\n\nJust got the typical MoneyLion response. THEY DO NOT FOLLOW UP. THIS IS A SCAM COMPANY! The response below is a lie.\n\nPlease contact me via the MoneyLion Ticket MoneyLion Support: OSD-120051",
