This company has said AND done everything their advertising claimed it would do for me within reason. InstaCash, CreditBuilding, Loans, Debt Relief, Investing, Cash Rewards etc. Yes you have to wait quite a bit to speak with a CSR sometimes. Just as with many places nowadays e.g. Social Security, Walmart, my primary care doctor. Still any/all issues I've ever had were resolved in a timely matter. Some tips- Please just stay respectful. They are not fraudulent or thieves. Their transparency is literally sent to you in writing. So make sure you read all of the fine print in the documents they send you so you aren't thrown for a loop if/when they follow through on their word. Lastly the FAQs can pretty much answer, and possibly resolve, 90% of what you call customer service for. I do highly recommend using MoneyLion if for nothing else, credit building, other financial opportunities, and investments.",
