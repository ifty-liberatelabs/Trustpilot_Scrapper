        "text": "Good company hobbled by a handful of smaller operational issues. I want to like this more, I wish I could rate higher.\n\nBeen with them for years. I like their credit builder loan product, and I like how easy they make it to buy crypto.\n\nBut everything about their edges is just rough. When something doesn't go right, nothing is ever resolved. Example:\n\nI want to start a new Moneylion Credit Builder Plus loan.\n\nThe app glitched out, and when I get to the final screen? When I click continue? Error Message.\n\nI have talked to support 4 different times now with 4 different proposed solutions. Two of the solutions involved follow-up from them in some way - once they offered to send me DocuSign emails to finish everything that way, and the last times they said engineering would be reaching out. Neither actually happened. Unforced errors. Stupid.\n\nOn top of that annoyance, the product changed. Now instead of a $500 microloan, it's $400 to the client with $100 kept in reserve. So now, not only can I not get a new little installment loan to keep in good standing on my credit report, I'm getting less cash whenever they do actually fix the problem. Stupid.\n\nPairing my new bank account never worked. I haven't used Regions as my primary bank for over a year, but I can't pair my new main account with them because... Reasons. Stupid.\n\nThey have had a few products \"coming soon\" for as long as I can remember. Credit cards? Forget it. Theyve been \"coming soon\" for 3+ years. Stupid. Larger loan amounts directly through them? \"Coming soon\", again, for years. Stupid.\n\n  They're great when stuff works but if something is broken don't expect them to fix it. Expect to waste your time pursuing a resolution that never comes.\n\nEdit: this response is a perfect encapsulation of all the complaints I've had thus far. I signed up to money lion using a personal email address that I have had for going on 20 years. The same email address was used to register for trustpilot, in fact it is the email address that alerted me to their reply. Somehow though, they can't find me.\n\nAnd just a feeling of overall unpreparedness or sloppiness, the dead hyperlink that was pasted into their official reply from the support team. This is the level of help to expect from this company. They have compelling offers, I've enjoyed using them for the most part, but if something goes wrong don't expect anyone to have the tools to figure it out.\n\nTo create a link, highlight the text you want to convert and press CTRL+K. (CMD+K on Mac.)\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nLastly. The link supplied is dead. It leads to a 404 error page.",
