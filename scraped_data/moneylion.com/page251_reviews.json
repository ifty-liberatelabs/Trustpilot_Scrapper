The only true complaint I can see is within the retentions department. Having to resend the same documents already sent and repeating steps already requested is especially burdensome and costly to the client if its not resolved within a short window. I myself suffered late fees totaling around $125 and a small high interest loan just to put food on my table for my son's.  But with there being a holiday it wouldn't be fair to say it's always this way. \n\nRoom for improvement. The apps start up is cumbersum and crowded. Those using older model phone's will find it crashing a lot before being able to access their information.  Report bugs, such as the apps refusal to acknowledge my need for a new card due to its own malfunction should be clearly visible so they can be sent by the user and addresses asap. Those receiving direct deposits due to benefits or social security should be recognized and not bombarded with continued adds requesting they start one theyve already established. Warnings about policy issues should be given before any attempts be made to lock a customer from their funds instead of surprising the customer and denying them access. Especually with a 5 day wait period.",

Once I got into the app I saw so much stuff that Chime did not offer. I love the fact that you offer different ways for people to save money. I can invest in crypto, I can invest in the stock market, I can choose where my spare change goes when I want to safe or something. I love the Insta cash. The credit builder is absolutely my favorite though. I was with you for a month and I got approved for a credit card which I’ve never been able to do my whole life. I appreciate that I’m able to build my credit up through your app. I will be a lifelong customer if you keep it up!",
