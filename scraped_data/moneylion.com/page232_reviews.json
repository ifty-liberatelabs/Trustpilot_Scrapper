The loan amount did not come immediately. 2 days later, when the loan amount still had not been deposited, I called customer service. I was told by the first person it was a latency problem and not to worry because people were already working on fixing it, but she had no clue how long it would be. I asked to talk to a supervisor. He told me it was not a latency problem. He submitted an escalation supposedly for the correct department to initiate the deposit right away and it would be done within the next 24 hours and that someone would email me by the end of the day to confirm. I got no email that day. And it’s been 3 days since that call, and I still don’t have my loan. If it wasn’t the weekend, I’d have called back by now though I do y expect anyone to actually know what’s going on or help in any way.",
