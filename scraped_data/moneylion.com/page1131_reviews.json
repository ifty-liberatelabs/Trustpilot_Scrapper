        "text": "If a bar had to be set for a fully automated mobile bank, Moneylion doesnt even deserve a participation award.\n\nI originally made an account for a credit building loan. It did help some with raising my credit score in the first couple months. The $20 fee/month is steep, though, and I would never trust this bank with my direct deposit to waive the fee.\n\nA few weeks ago my alternator and battery crapped out on me, and then I blew two tires, fortunately right after payday. I wanted a small buffer to make sure my boyfriend and I could make it a few days before his paycheck came in, as we share an account. So I used instacash for $50. Tried to use turbo and it refused to take my card info, so I was stuck waiting the 2-3 days. When I agreed it said that the due date would be on my next paydate. There was a pop-up asking for a $3 tip, and I agreed thinking that the tip was part of the $50 and I'd be charged $53. I moved the slider to the $3 on the next page, as well, not realizing they were separate. The next day there's a $3 transaction for the tip. The money deposited in two days, and then I get a text stating that $53 will be billed the next day. So they beg for tips a lot, which I'd get if they didn't already charge $20/month, but that's ridiculous and greedy. I feel duped because of the way they present the additional request for tips. As for the instacash, I logged in and it back dated my due date to my last paycheck. I regret not screenshotting the page showing my due date because I know 100% for a fact what I agreed to and it was not to be billed as soon as their ridiculously slow system finally processed and decided that it wanted to change the terms after agreement. I sent an email asking them to defer payment. They told me there's nothing they can do because it's all automated. I responded that their automated system backdated my due date and I did not agree to a previous payday being my due date, and I received an email back essentially stating that I'm wrong and that I did agree to that because \"they did disclose all the information\" right after I was told that this is a known error that their engineers are working on because it's apparently common. That is absolute horsesh!t. For one, don't tell me it's a known problem and then tell me it's my fault because your system disclosed the info. It obviously didn't. And two, the fact that there's an entirely automated system handling people's money that not a single person can assist with when it breaks baffles me. If you want to have a fully automated system like that, at least make sure it works before you start taking people's money. Technology breaks. We need real people in order to fix the inevitable.\n\nI hate that calling to ask questions, waiting on hold or for a callback, results in \"make sure your app is updated and do it yourself.\" What is the point of customer service?\nTheir automation is so flawed it hurts. My debit card was stolen and it resulted in a missed membership payment. I made it up as soon as i noticed it shortly after and it took two months to process. I emailed asking why, if the payment went through (they took money same day), and if not should I call in to pay it. They said it went through but takes 3-5 days to process and that they can't take payments over the phone. This is laughable, as I called in 60 says later to ask and all it did was raise more questions, such as:  What the hell CAN your customer service do?? Aside from snotty emails telling me I'm wrong after acknowledging their system is basically broken and telling me to do it myself and call back with questions.\n\nI'm all for technology and automation done right, but this is a perfect example of flawed execution. People are necessary. If you want a half-baked company, at least make one that doesn't handle your finances. That's the worst thing to half-bake.",

I called in 45 minutes later with back and forth discussion and finally the rep told me that,YOU CAN NOT REDEEM THESE REWARDS UNLESS YOU HAVE OUR CHECKING ACCOUNT OR CREDIT CARD!!!!! SO THEY'VE SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE REPEATEDLY AND THEN SAID WE'RE GOING TO COMPENSATE YOU FOR THIS BUT NOW WE CAN'T SO WE WANT TO SLAP YOU ONE MORE TIME! the rep then said, a supervisor will be calling you back but I'm very sorry for what you have gone through.I asked him did he see the string of emails that I've had over issues and he said,\"YES\"!  UNBELIEVABLE AWFUL EXPERIENCE!\n\nUpdate- it seems all is resolved but was only able to redeem 1 $25 Walmart giftcard. Let me know when I'm able to redeem the other as I have followed the advice of 2 of your reps now and no luck.\n\nUpdate- Here we are feb.16 and still never given the 2nd gift card that they mention they gave me on their follow up. They've had me do different things to try to use the 2nd one they mentioned but there app won't let me. It's just another technical issue they have. I'm done with them. Thanks for the wonderful compensation that you acted like you gave me for the hell you put me through. Keep your other pretend $25 that you acted like I could redeem. I'm absolutely 100% done with Moneylion.",

I then decide to use them as my primary bank for direct deposit and that’s when things got shady! My daily atm withdrawal limit is $510, I decided on 1/30/20 to withdraw $400 from an ATM. I could only withdraw $200 dollars at a time plus the fee for using an out of network atm so it was $202 to be charged to my account TWICE. Once I got home I decide to check my account and I see that it states I withdrew $202 THREE TIMES totalling $606 which is over my daily limit if $510! I called in which takes forever for that voice prompt to allow you to speak to someone who is no help! and they told to fill out a form online! I submit the form and no confirmation email within 24 hours so i call on 2/1/20! This rep tells me they’ve had issues similar but they have to investigate! Why?? She also asked if i had receipts for my previous withdrawals because that would be HELPUL!? How???? When this account doesn’t let you overdraft, take out more than your daily limit, what is there to investigate?!? I want my money refunded I don’t want to wait 15 days for a BS investigation! Most horrible bank ever I am so upset my account is at negative and they don’t even credit your account as it states on their ZENDESK. STAY AWAY!!! There are second chance bank accounts and other banks that don’t charge fees and if you need pay day loans try Dave, BRIGIT, EARNIN!!!",

I emailed asking for help well before the next due day. NO RESPONSE. \n\nCustomer service does not have a good process for collecting payment either. Once I got someone on the phone to pay off the entire loan (because I got sick of them and their incompetent app and website), the customer service agent tried my payment and came back saying it was declined and asked did I have enough money on my account. I have money to cover the transactions!!!! This lady tried to run a payment of 21.50 (TEN) times on my debit card.NO WONDER WHY THE BANK STARTED DECLINING. I told her well duh obviously you have locked my debit card. My bank texted my saying they have an active fraud alert. Which is Money Lion. \n\nWhy not process the lump sum payment instead of 10 separate transactions. Of course a bank will believe it is FRAUD. Now I have to go through this process of unlocking my debit card!!! Now I cannot use my card for anything. Just about gonna say F -- IT! \n\nIt is such a hassle to even pay your damn bill with these folks. All of this happened because the app and website does not work properly. You cannot even update bank information properly. They need to work on their technical difficulties and improve customer service. This is a SCAM!",

(or you can pay off in full). \n\n- Moneylion offers Credit Building -BUT THEY DON'T, because Its not reported to credit agencies per month. ITS MORE LIKE CREDIT DEMOLITION - ONLY TAKES AFFECT WHEN LOAN GOES IN DEFAULT (meaning, if you miss a payment, they tell the Credit Agencies you missed a payment and liquid your investment account to cover the cost of the default loan AND YOURE LEFT WITH A BAD CREDIT REPORT. \n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n - OFFERS DEALS SUCH A 1$ CASHBACK FOR CERTAIN ACTIONS TAKEN ON ACCOUNT, THEN CANCELLING 1$ CASHBACK AFTER REACHING HIGH CUSTOMER VOLUMES.??!!\n\n - CHANGES LOAN ApR TO ACCOMMODATE LOSS OF CUSTOMERS.?!!!\n\n - FALSE ADVERTISING LOANS ?!!!\n\n - Unorganized system updating ??!!\n\n - OUT OF COUNTRY CUSTOMER SUPPORT !!!??\n\n - Bad Phone system algorithms ??!!!\n\n - OUTSOURCED COMPANY PARTNERSHIPS control the speed of service of which Moneylion is supposedly controlling. !!!\n\n\n\nThank you for your time. - Take my words for what they are. SERIOUS + SPREAD THE MESSAGE TO HELP DETER HUMANS FROM UNNECESSARY, UNETHICAL EXPENSES PROVIDED BY SUCH COMPANIES.\n\n-\n\nZ3R0",

Well its been a year and not only have I saved money but I have learned to be smart with my money, track where I spend my money.. and I am now investing my money! The $500 loan I received has helped my credit. Money lion is apart of my plan of financial literacy. When I first signed up I was living pay check to pay check. Not anymore! My credit has went up over 100 points and I am setting myself up to buy a home AND invest even more. Money Lion has been a great factor to my success. Have a plan in mind, then execute it!",
