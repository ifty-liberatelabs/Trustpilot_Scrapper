        "text": "What a rip-off scam. They make it sound like the Instant Cash is something you will get immediately. That is not true. It will go into your Roar money wallet instantly, but there's nothing you can do with it from there. I needed money immediately for an emergency medical issue. I thought that the Instant Cash would be instantaneously like they say. You have to pay a fee to get it instantly. I paid 799 the first time. I paid 599 the second time. I don't remember what I paid the third time. The reason I kept requesting additional money, is because for three days I was on the phone, or is it a chat with customer service or a bot.. customer service repeatedly told me that I could get the cash instantly if I went through a third-party app such as PayPal, cash out, or venmo. Moneylion would not linked to any of those and it would not send cash to those apps. They had me spend extra money to get it super fast just so that I would never receive it. I still haven't received it. It takes 3 to 5 days to get into my bank, and that's the only place it will allow me to transfer the money to. I have to pay all these extra fees on top of the amount that they won't cancel. I asked them to cancel all transactions Since I no longer need their money oh, and they say that's impossible. I don't think it's impossible, but nevertheless they won't do it. Nobody knows where the money is that I paid to have immediately. The virtual debit card doesn't work for anything. I don't know why they have it. They say online that you can go to a Allpoint ATM and use it to withdraw cash. That is not true. There is no way that you can do it. I downloaded all these third-party apps, in an effort to link them to moneylion, and moneylion would not linked to them. It did linked to PayPal but it wouldn't send money to PayPal. It wouldn't send money to my debit card because the error message said there was a security problem. It was absolutely no way to get cash immediately and I feel that very deceiving did they write that and their description online over and over again. They also say no fees. Yes there is a fee to get instant cash that you can't get your hands on. The contact list ATMs that they have so many of don't work with the moneylion virtual card. That virtual card is useless. I think it's atrocious that they gave me the wrong information repeatedly and I have to pay for wrong information. It's a rip-off. Don't do it. Don't download the app. I asked them to cancel these transactions that still have not made it to my bank and they won't. I asked them to take back their money that is in their money lion wallet and they won't. They just want me to pay the extra fees. Plus transfer fees. I'm so sorry I ever got involved with this app",
