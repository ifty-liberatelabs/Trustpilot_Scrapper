The constant begging for tips is ridiculous. You also automatically set the default to $5 despite initially putting no. \n\nInstead of helping one save and invest better, your app over all has been a bad investment and option for such a thing. It’s very anti-consumer, and it appears more so like that now after a whole year of using the service.",

Just be sure to read the screens and make your selections carefully, and you can use Instacash without tips or fees if you choose. That said, if you choose to leave a tip — thank you! It helps us cover the costs of providing 0% APR cash advance to many, many folks like you!",
