        "text": "It doesnt state a membership fee. It clearly states join for Free. It also doesnt state a member ship fee or any additional fee on my biweekly payment amount due.  After the loan is approved it states log in every day and earn a dollar. It doesnt state that that amount would go towards a membership fee of 79.99. Because again it says join for free. Free membership if you Qualified for the loan. Had this information been clear on your website it would give customers an option to go through with the loan or not. Very deseptive. Regardless of getting it back once loan is paid and you must long in every day to get 1 dollar credit between 29$ and 31$ (Days in a month) which the website makes it seem like a perk to log in every day and get 1 per day but in actuality you must log in to get the credit to be applied to your membership fee of 79.99. Again website says join for free. Even if its only free for 30 days. I was still charged less than a week from recieving the loan a membership fee. I dont have a problem paying the loan. I dont like to be decieved on membership  fees that says  free membership if you qualify for the loan which I did. Spoke to louis he agreed with me that the web site should be clear on the membership fee and not say free. But when I recieved my supervisor request email. He states that he explained it is on the web site. So glad I recorded all phone calls and screen shot the whole loan process. I have no problem paying my loan. I HAVE HUGE PROBLEM WITH HIDDEN FEES THAT SAY FREE. DISPUTING THROUGH MY BANK THE MEMBERSHIP FEE",

            "message": "Hi Natale,\n\n\nYou are able to join Moneylion and for free and take advantage of our free tools such as Credit Monitoring, Credit simulator tool without charge. \n\nYou signed up for our Moneylion Plus membership which does come with a $79/month fee which is shown during the initial sign up multiple times along with the payment schedule which includes the membership fee along with the loan payment.\n\nMoneylion Plus membership gives you access to a loan with a 5.99% APR along with $50 of the $79 going into a money market savings account. By logging into the Moneylion app and going through the cards daily, you can earn $1/day cashback which is then deposited into the savings account which is projected to earn you ~$2,000+ within 2 years being that the account isn't closed early or withdrawals aren't prematurely made. Moneylion Plus is also a program designed to help build credit.\n\nIf you log into the app every day, it essentially covers the price of the subscription fee plus more. For example, if you logged into the app daily for 31 days to receive the $31 plus the $50 that goes into the savings account you would have $81 in the account after only paying $79 for the membership fee. This essentially means that you are getting more than what you are paying into it which covers the full cost plus a little extra of the membership in the long run. \n\nI hope this helps to clear up any confusion you may have had about the membership. \n\nThank you,\n\nMoneylion",
