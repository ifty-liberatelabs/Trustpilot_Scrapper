Couple things I dont like: you cant use the credit builder plus loan program unless you have a separate bank account, how does that make sense? They aren't signed up for plaid, so you cant link your bank to any online service that uses it which is alot of places. They charge atm fees for almost everywhere. They also dont have mobile check uploading which is a huge let down. The bad outways the good in my opinion and I would not reccomend using this bank.",

            "message": "Hello Alex!\n\nOur loans are perfect for those who have no credit or need to rebuild credit. There’s no credit check! You simply link your checking account in the MoneyLion app or dashboard, and we’ll review it for financial and other factors. If you qualify, you’ll get a personalized loan offer up to $1,000. The offer will show you how much of your loan funds you’ll get right away and how much will be saved in a Credit Reserve Account and given to you when you’ve paid your loan in full. This is to help you save while you build credit!\nAn $2.50 fee occurs when funds are requested from a ATM that is not within network.\nATM’s that are within network can be found in our mobile app under the “More” button than select “MoneyLion checking” and select “Find ATM”. You can also simply visit allpointnetwork.com to find a ATM within network. \nWe appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly. \n",
