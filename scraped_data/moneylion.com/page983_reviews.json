Additionally, we designed Instacash to help you access smaller amounts of cash in a pinch, such as for an unexpected late fee or a can't-miss date night and we designed it to be easy to pay back! It isn't meant to be a way to fund your larger expenses. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in maximum increments of $50. We appreciate your feedback regarding InstaCash so that we can continue to improve our products and services. It’s members like you that help make MoneyLion ROAR!

How soon you can get your funds depends on the delivery method you choose and whether you're sending the funds to your RoarMoney account. We offer turbo delivery options to your RoarMoney or external account for a small fee of $3.99 - $4.99 so that you may receive your funds instantly. Alternatively, we offer free delivery options within 24-48 hours to your RoarMoney account or 3-5 business days to an external account. Additionally, tips are absolutely optional, and do not impact eligibility or availability, however, we encourage you support the community and we highly appreciate it! You see, it takes a big team here at MoneyLion to keep 0% APR Instacash running smoothly 24/7. Your tips are what help us cover the high costs of administering Instacash at 0% APR for the large and growing MoneyLion community.
