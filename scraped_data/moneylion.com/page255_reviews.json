Moneylions banking website is useless. You cannot access transactions or bank statements from their website. The only way you can do banking is via the App. You can only use the app to view your transactions or bank statements. The website is useless. How can you call it online banking if you are not able to review your transactions online. \n2. The fraudulent transactions need to post for the bank to take action, however in my experience these transactions are in process status for ever with all of my balance deducted / hold because of this fraud. I contacted the bank for help since it's been like a month and my money is stuck the bank is asking me to contact these merchants and ask them to send Money Lion an email to remove the hold\n3. Customer Service Sucks, they don't know their how their own products or services work.\nI'm waiting for this issue to be resolved so I can go back to my other Major banks such as Bank of America who's first action on fraud is to give you your refund and then investigate, however Moneylion s policies look different, you got to print and sign a form and send it back with in 10 days, you don't hear back from them, then they say they didn't get the form. trust me it's been a night mare \nI have also sent several emails \nRequested to speak to someone in the corporate office. Requested for a call back from someone in the US but to no avail.\n\nI hope I get back my money that were fraudulent transactions. I'm gonna say good bye to these folks once I do that",
