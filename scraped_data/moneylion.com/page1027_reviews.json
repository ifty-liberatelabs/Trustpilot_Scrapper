            "message": "Hi there, Alise. We appreciate your feedback so we can continue to improve our products and services. It’s members like you that help make MoneyLion ROAR! To provide better information, after you unlock Instacash, the exact amount you have available each Instacash cycle (typically time with your pay cycle) will be based on factors in your linked checking account, primarily whether we can detect recent qualifying income and are able to predict when you'll be able to repay your Instacash. If we detect recent qualifying income, you'll have access to up to $200 depending on the income amount. If we can't, you'll have access to a lower amount but not less than $25. In other words, as your linked checking account's financial factors change (such as an increase, decrease, or change in the regularity of in detectable income), your Instacash limit may go up and down between $25 and $200 accordingly. Similarly, if the amount of your deposit goes up or down, your Instacash limit may go up and down with it. The maximum amount you will have access to is $250. If we cannot determine if the direct deposit in your MoneyLion checking account is regularly recurring (i.e with a standard pay frequency of either weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly) you'll have access to a lower amount but not less than $50. Given you’ve expressed a positive experience with MoneyLion, would you be open to also sharing this review on other review sites, including Google Play, Trustpilot, BBB, and Wallethub. Thanks again for being the best part of MoneyLion!",
