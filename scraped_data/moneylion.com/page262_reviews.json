Once I decided to use it I was only able to borrow $50 at a time. Then to get it you either have to send it to RoarMoney which is free but then you have to pay to get it to your bank unless you want to wait a few days. If you skip RoarMoney and want it to go directly to your bank there is a fee, or your debit card a fee. However you get your money, unless you have changed your banking to Money Lion and you have direct deposit set up and a debit card with them, they charge outrageous fees to get your money. And since you can only get so much at a time, you pay the fees each time. It adds up. I have been with my bank for 20 years and I am not going to change it to bank with a mobile app. It is a good service if you do not mind all the fees.",
