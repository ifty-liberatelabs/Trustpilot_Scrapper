We're happy to know that our 0% InstaCash is able to provide assistance and help you with securing that financial stability! It’s members like you that help makes MoneyLion ROAR! To provide better assistance, Instacash repayments are automated, making it easy to pay on time and replenish your Instacash so it's ready when you need it next. You can manually repay Instacash using your RoarMoney account or the debit card that you have linked for Instacash repayment! From your MoneyLion app home screen, select Instacash and hit 'Repay'. Choose the debit card that you have linked for repayment or your RoarMoney account. Either way, ensure you have enough funds in your account BEFORE you repay because the system will immediately attempt to repay the amount once you select to repay! You may also make a partial payment if you like. The full Instacash repayment will still be due, and you can come back and pay the rest back later.
