YOU CHARGE $360 A YEAR. SO WHY, WHEN I GO TO TAKE OUT $300, DO YOU FLOOD ME WITH AD AFTER AD ASKING FOR A \"TIP\"? (PS you can write \"optional\" in whatever color you want. When an app with all our personal and banking info makes it clear they expect an \"optional\" cash deposit, I can't help but note the similarities to the business model in my favorite mob movies.)\n\nTO CLARIFY: A ML CUSTOMER IS NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOUR HARD WORK, THEY ARE PAYING YOU 30 DOLLARS A MONTH FOR IT. NO MATTER HOW MANY PICTURES OF SAD LITTLE GIRLS FROM STOCKPHOTOS.COM YOU USE TO GUILT US. IF YOUR EMPLOYEES WORK HARD, PAY THEM MORE. I DON'T PAY $150 A MONTH THEN SEND A 10% CASH TIP TO VERIZON EVERYTIME THEY DELIVER MY TEXT MESSAGE SUCCESSFULLY LIKE IT WAS A FAVOR.\n\nSorry for shouting. But for the people who don't deal with this every day, the main reason I pay $30 a month is for access to this feature, which has been worth it during Covid. You know what makes it not worth it? When in addition to the $30 a month, you make us take the $300 out in $50 max increments, creating 6 separate transactions instead of 1. \n\nAKA: 6 chances to charge $4.99 to cash out, but more importantly, 6 CHANCES TO SEND 5 POPUPS EACH ASKING FOR AN \"OPTIONAL\" TIP, AFTER REMINDING YOU YOU \"FORGOT\" THE \"OPTIONAL\" TIP LAST $50. I'm not exaggerating, try it: 4 popups and 1 screen where it DEFAULTS TO $5 SO IF YOU MISS IT, YOU TIP $5 ON $50.\n\nSO, TO TAKE OUT $300 TODAY: I did 6 transactions of $50.I saw 30 ads to \"leave an optional 10% tip\" - for fun, let's say I was going blind and missed the sneaky $5 tip they snuck in without asking. That's $30 in tips, 24 ads clicked out of. I paid $30 in fees to transfer it out, and my $30 monthly just to have Moneylion. So, while they harrass you for tips bc it's \"0% APR\", you just got $210 and owe $322.96 in two weeks. And if you missed their sneaky tip addition, that's a 35% APR. and you tipped $30 for it.",
