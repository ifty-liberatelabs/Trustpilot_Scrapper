        "text": "Everything about this app has been amazing since I downloaded it! Hetting access to instant cash to how its set up to help people including myself get our credit back on track.  Payday advances, small personal loans, even investing! Everything you can possibly think of is here on this app! I just started using money lion not to long ago so I'm sure there's more I don't even know about yet and I'm excited to find out, but I honestly have absolutely nothing negative to say about money lion. It's been a blessing. Thank you!",
