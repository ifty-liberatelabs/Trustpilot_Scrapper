The offer will show you how much of your loan funds you’ll get right away and how much will be saved in a Credit Reserve Account and then given to you when you’ve paid your loan in full. This is to help you save while you build credit!Your Credit Reserve Account is an interest-bearing account maintained by MoneyLion’s SEC-registered investment advisor. If you default on your loan, your Credit Reserve Account may be liquidated to partially or fully pay off what you owe. We appreciate your feedback. We will be reaching out to you directly to go over this as well.  ",
