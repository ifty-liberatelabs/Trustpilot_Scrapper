Unique and pretty streamlined! Their instacash option is also pretty amazing! They are not your typical bank and that's what I love about them the most! 5 stats!",

When I pay it up my money is now available to be withdrawn as needed later in the month. The only app better is Branch, and that's only because they allow me to utilize $500 as opposed to $275. App is easy to use, verification isn't painfully complicated, when I do have an issue they respond quickly and actually fix the problem as opposed to blowing policy smoke up your bum as is becoming alarmingly popular amongst companies everywhere. Good job MoneyLion, keep it up!",
