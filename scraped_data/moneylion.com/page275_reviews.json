        "text": "I‚Äôm happy with the Instacash app‚Ä¶ but as far as the credit builder plus app, I have a couple issues. It doesn‚Äôt make sense that you only get the $250 and pay it back, along with the interest, membership fees for both apps, and tips‚Ä¶at least 4 different fees! That‚Äôs super excessive. I understand the tips and maybe 1 fee for membership. Then when I cancelled the credit builder plus app, I‚Äôm still getting charged the membership fees for both apps :( I cancelled credit builder plus Bc it completely defeats the purpose. I‚Äôm want to build my credit, SAVE money, and it‚Äôs nice to have the convenience of borrowing smaller amounts and paying back. It does NOT make sense to receive the $250 (credit builder) and once paid, you can‚Äôt get anything else until you pay $600 up front?!?!?! If I could do that, I wouldn‚Äôt need this app. So that‚Äôs why I cancelled that portion, and to top it off it was incredibly difficult to cancel. I had to call and be on hold 5 different times even though I had already paid back the $250 and all interest fees and was willing to pay whatever extra I needed too (which also was ridiculous but whatever)‚Ä¶ I was willing to do just about anything to just cancel it. Honestly, Bc of that experience I would not feel comfortable opening a banking account with MoneyLion. I‚Äôm still getting charged double membership fees and was told that it will not be taken away. The only thing keeping me with MoneyLion is Instacash. It‚Äôs truly a lifesaver for me right now. I wish I had never even tried credit builder. Hopefully you guys can find a way to make some improvements to the app.",
