Whatever you do, DO NOT do any kind of business with these people! \n\nOn January 15th, 2020, MONEYLION fraudulently opened a $500 credit builder PLUS loan in my name. I was not aware of this account until it was negatively reported on my credit reports on May 11, 2020. I have contacted them and even paid the fraudulent loan off to protect my credit as my condo burned down and I am buying a house. I have filed complaints not only with MONEYLION but with the FTC, the CFPB, the BBB, and The New York Attorney General’s Office in Albany.  I also filed a police report.  I submitted all documentation to both the credit bureaus and to MONEYLION but they refuse to remove the fraudulent account, let alone update any credit reporting.\nThis has taken a huge hit on my credit and my mortgage was denied because of this illegal and fraudulent account. They refuse to correct this injustice and I am prepared to take this to court.\n\nNobody answered the phone when you call, or if they do, they don’t speak English.  This company outsources to Malaysia so they don’t feel they have to follow the laws of the United States.  They have marked my credit 30 days late even though this is an account that was opened by fraud and identity theft.  They don’t care to help people.  I am going to take MONEYLION to court.  I want my $500 back that I paid as well as $59.97 in “monthly fees” that I also paid to make sure my credit was protected.  They don’t respond to any emails you send and refuse to admit they are a company that illegally opens accounts.  They had two separate accounts in my name with two separate social security numbers.  Have they removed either account?  Nope!  \n\nI intend on taking MONEYLION to court and they will pay dearly.  My attorney is going to hit them hard.  I’ve spent hours, upon hours, upon hours working on this and the company simply doesn’t care to correct anything.  \n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THE FRAUDULENT MONEYLION!",

I've been trying to figure out a mysterious charge that popped up on my bank account from them. I've literally spent up to eleven days now trying to get a hold of somebody. Everyone from customer support told me the wait time is ten days. Yesterday the customer support person said that they HAD to reach out to me by the end of the day. Someone did but all they wanted was my information, and then there was nothing. Now the person that I'm talking to literally is telling me that it was for a loan payment, but my bank transaction is showing I already paid my loan, my membership, etc. Trying to talk to someone is a total joke. I can't imagine what would happen if someone actually hacked into my account, and accessed my information. It would probably take forever before someone even responds to help me with the situation. This isn't okay. The customer support needs to be better! This is someone's money we are talking about here.",
