I gave up for awhile because it had been long enough period between times that I had done forgot my information because I had changed phone systems from android to apple back to android and my information has been lost because I had assisted touch on one night not realizing  it or how to go about changing anything because this was my one and only iPhone and me not having an up to date mac/iTunes on it nor the means to do so at that point cause where trying to get funds to get a vehicle pay off mortgage of what's left and home improvement loan for things needed as well as like to go green because weve wiped our savings out we bought the house as a fixer upper not realizing the validity of that meaning for this house we have had to replace all the pipes, all the fixtures, toilet, sinks, new doors, new floors, new windows, new woodstove, washer, dryer, oven, refrigerator new vinyl flooring, cabinets. Then after we got done with all that, the water pump went out and it was 250 feet down that was $22,000 split 5 ways . Then the axle breaks on the car we just inherited from my wife's mother . So know we dont have a vehicle and my wife is handicapped now because of C.M.T., Neuropathy, as well as crippling Reumatoid arthritis to the point of using a four pronged cain as well as a wheelchair. And we where always a very active family like fishing hunting and camping and shes just fixing to turn 48 in October so its killing her to have to depend on me like she does. All in all though I have faith in this place as well as you folks I want to thank you for the new info and I'm going to give it a shot Thank You Michael Pugh",
