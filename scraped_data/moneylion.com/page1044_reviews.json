I have always found myself behind the 8-ball when it came to receiving my credit reserve and the proper amounts of InstaCare. Every time I tried to pay my membership fee I couldn't. I wish there was a way I could pay my credit plus membership with a debit card it would be much easier. When I talk to customer service their knowledge of what was going on with limited because the system was responsible for initiating the deposit and the credit plus loan Reserve deposit which took too long. And for the Instant Cash the detection of relevant income was never detected even though I received the required amount of direct deposit. I like moneylion but I don't like the system that runs money lion. When it comes to investing in baking I believe it should be left in the hands of competent humans. I wish my experience with money lion was a little bit better but I will do my best to continue with money lion.",
