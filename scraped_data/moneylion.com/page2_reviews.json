Or at least that's how it's supposed to work. \n\nI paid mine in full going on two months ago now. The money never came. \nI contacted them and they kept telling me to wait. After a month I contacted them again, then they started saying they sent it already and it was deposited. \n\nI checked my bank....nope. called my bank....nope. \nContacted money lion again and they said I had to give them my personal bank statements with ALL of my info or else they couldn't verify I didn't get the money. \n\nAfter much reluctance and a week later I finally sent the statement. Showing proof I had never recieved anything from them. \n\nIt's now been almost a month after that and I still have not received anything. All they do is keep emailing me saying they are still working on it. \n\nThey have my bank statement. They can clearly see I never received the money. \n\nAt this point they've stolen over $850 from me and if you are considering using this company I highly discourage it. \n\nI was depending on that return for other bills. \nThey do not care and they will not help. Also every email they send has a number at the bottom you can \"call\" that leads to a dead phone line\n\nUpdate: they have finally said they sent the money though I have not received it yet. \nAnd then they turned around and wrote my account as a charge off on my credit report. Not during this entire process. But after this initial review and fighting for my own money. \n\nDo not use this company",

        "text": "Well I'm going on day five of my three to five day response time for my issue, and it's not looking good.\nI really thought this would be an easy fix because clearly I have completed the milestones I needed to pass within the timeframe allotted.  I sent screenshots showing I was well beyond the levels I needed credit for and honestly I can't figure out how you could cheat or fake that,  but idk.\nAnyway, it's only about $5, but when I contacted their customer service via email they were kinda rude. I was asked if I was even the owner of the account, which is stupid because why would I be wasting my time if it wasn't my account.\nSo, I'll be back to update this after tomorrow, again, the fifth day.\nAlso I found the first time I submitted my ticket and that was way back on January 12.\nAnd I had a slightly similar issue on kashkick but it was for $10 and they fixed it in one day with only four emails.\n\nOk, so now its January 28th, so 16 days, and  I received an email saying they were closing my ticket since they hadn't heard from me, which is ridiculous because I was told to wait for a response from them.\nSo I told them they issue was still not resolved and if they close the ticket I will make a new one.\nSo about 3 days ago in an email I was told there are still no updates but they are working on it.\nI went and looked at the specific game and I still have 54 days left to finish the missions.\nAll the other missions are checked off except the last 3, so to me, once again, I don't know what the deal is. I even sent pics of the screen time spent on the game and it over 9 hours. To me, the proof is all there so I don't know what needs to be investigated. But none the less, I put in the time and I will persist until I get the credits that are due to me.",

While the core concept holds merit, and customer service is generally responsive, certain aspects of the platform require improvement.\n\nThe Instacash feature, while potentially beneficial for short-term financial needs, presents significant fee-related concerns. The relatively low borrowing limits, typically around $100, coupled with per-transaction fees, can result in substantial costs for users. Furthermore, exceeding the borrowing limit can lead to even higher fees, exacerbating financial burdens.\n\nThe user interface, while offering a wealth of information, can feel cluttered and impede efficient navigation towards personal financial data. Moreover, the frequency of promotional communications, including text messages and emails, can be perceived as excessive and intrusive",
