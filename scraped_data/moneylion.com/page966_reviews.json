It’s 4.99 to get the money quickly and they say the tipping is optional but then tells you you need to tip the next time. I get needing to keep the service up and running but it could just be mandatory like the 4.99 fee to get the money quicker. Besides that one gripe I really like the app on pretty much ease alone.",

It’s members like you that help make MoneyLion ROAR! Additionally, after you unlock Instacash, the exact amount you have available each Instacash cycle (typically time with your pay cycle) will be based on factors in your linked checking account, primarily whether we can detect recent qualifying income and are able to predict when you'll be able to repay your Instacash. If we detect recent qualifying income, you'll have access to up to $200 depending on the income amount. If we can't, you'll have access to a lower amount but not less than $25. In other words, as your linked checking account's financial factors change (such as an increase, decrease, or change in the regularity of in detectable income), your Instacash limit may go up and down between $25 and $200 accordingly.  Given you’ve expressed a positive experience with MoneyLion, would you be open to also sharing this review on other review sites, including Google Play, Apple Store, BBB, and Wallethub? Thanks again for being the best part of MoneyLion!",

It’s members like you that help make MoneyLion ROAR! Additionally, regarding our Credit Builder Plus loan, there’s no credit check to apply and you don’t need good credit to be eligible. You can even apply if you don’t have any credit history at all. To get started, just link your primary checking account, and we’ll securely scan your finances to see if you qualify. The account you link must meet the following criteria: A checking or spending account in good standing (at MoneyLion’s discretion) with a detectable income stream (i.e. it’s where you deposit your paychecks/salary/benefits checks). Savings and money market accounts will not qualify, the account has been open for at least 60 days, and the account demonstrates an acceptable balance and active transaction history (at MoneyLion’s discretion).
