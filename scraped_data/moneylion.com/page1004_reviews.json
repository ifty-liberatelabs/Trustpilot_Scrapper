I chatted with a rep and the rep was very rude and just told me that the engineers were aware of the issue.  No sympathy did not try to help in anyway and was very unprofessional.   It would have eased my mind if the rep would have been some what compassionate. Now I have the feeling that I will never get my deposit from my job.   Seriously thinking about just closing this account.  It seems to be something going on all the time.  Here it is rent day.  And I don’t have my own money to pay it.   What a joke!!!!!!!!!!",
