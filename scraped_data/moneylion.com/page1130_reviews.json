For Credit Builder Loan, the amount they'll be receiving, rates, terms, and conditions are all presented on the mobile application before they proceed to the final step. You also have two options for accessing the money in your Reserve Account, as long as your Credit Builder Plus membership fees are up to date: First, you can make your regularly scheduled payments on the full $500 until the $500 loan is paid off. As soon as it’s paid off, the funds from your Credit Reserve Account will be sent to your checking account for you to enjoy. Lastly, you can use your Credit Reserve Account money to help pay off your $500 loan in full at any time. To be clear, you can’t use your Reserve Account money to make loan payments; you can only use it to pay off your loan in full. You can contact us directly at 801-252-4427 or visit our FAQs online: help.moneylion.com for further questions about Credit Builder Plus Loan/Membership and more. Thank you!",

I’ve already reported to the BBB.\nMy account and debit card have both been locked since Monday March 2nd. I never received an email, phone call, or any type of notification that this was taking place. I only found out on March 4th when my landlord called me and said my rent payment declined. Being that it’s the first week of the month, I purposefully set aside over $1,000 in my account for monthly bills. When I was finally able to speak to a customer service representative (the call lasted 30 minutes, but I was on hold on and off for 20 minutes) I was told my account was locked and my address needed to be verified. I was then told by the representative that my account could be under review for 30 days. He then said I would be receiving an email detailing why this lock was placed and what documents to send over. No email was ever sent. Today, March 6th, I was able to speak to a supervisor who assured me my account would be unlocked within the hour. My account is still locked. I’ve called probably 20 times within the last 3 days and each time I get told something different as to why my account was locked. I was first told my address needed to be verified, then it was unusual purchase activity. All purchases on the account where made by me in the city I have lived in for the past 2 years. On March 5th, I was told my account was unlocked and was able to make purchases, this was another lie. This account is where I have my direct deposits set up. I have no access to any of my funds, meaning I can’t pay any of my bills. \nCustomer service is one of the most important elements successful businesses have. After switching over from a larger bank institution to this one, I can truly say this company’s customer service is useless. There are support forms which you can fill out online, but no one responds. When you do get a chance to finally speak to a customer service representative they keep you on hold and don’t even try to fix the issue. Keeping customers should be the company’s number one priority, not pushing them away.",

So they pretty much made an extra $12 from me plus the money that was paid back ($162). Here’s where it gets sketchy, they money was automatically taken from my account on February 28, 2020 it’s March 6th and my account still says I owe them money for the instaloan. I was told that it took 5 business days for the funds to be shown on my account and it has 5 days today (March 6th). Y’all took the money so quickly from me but not quick to update your systems. If this is not resolved immediately I’m creating a dispute with my bank.",

        "text": "Generally I hate giving bad reviews, especially when it's hard to tell when a company has bad intentions or is just incompetent. Might be a combination of both, but when your company is this terrible, appears to be taking advantage of people's money and responds to complaints with, \"Hey, Bob, that money is transfered now!\" as if it isn't too little too late, it's time to bounce. In a way, I'm partially responsible because I saw the red flags months ago and even started putting most of my direct deposit into a different bank account - but, alas, I'm a glutton for punishment to the extent I go broke. There are a few things that suck about moneylion, and there's no reason in 2020 a place I heard a finance show actually refer to as a pioneer in Fintech (obv part of marketing talking point) shouldn't have certain features in place. Let me tell you my story and follow up with some of the missing features that even brick and morter stores are offering.\n\nMy ML account took one of its final, dying gasps a couple of days ago when a fraud detection company (Shazam? Seriously?) called me in the morning while I was sleeping, asked if I recognized a couple small charges on my debit card, and when I said in confusion No I don't think so, deactivated my card. I had no idea I would have no access to the money in my account, and - although not the norm, but all the money I HAD for the week - for at least 7 days. Why? Because it would be 7-10 days before my new ML card would show up. My alternatives? Their godawful support team told me (12 hours after I emailed them originally, and multiple times following up with frustration and urgency) \"if\" I have PayPal linked to my checking account (how about if I have PP at all?) I can transfer money from ML to PP and get the money from there. What they failed to tell me is that if you don't already have ML linked to PP, you have to wait 3-5 days to verify the account. Tried Venmo, MoneyGram, Western Union...nope, nope and nope. Google Pay, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay? No-no-no. Cashapp? Invalid account numbers. So, if you use ML and some place called Shazam calls you while you are sleeping and asks you if you bought some weird stuff, just say yes.\nThe 2nd thing that is patently dumb is the way they link accounts within their trashy app. You can't change anything. Want to fund it with a different bank account? Too bad. \nThe third thing is, you can't link them to other banks from the other banks' apps because ML IS NOT listed in Plaid's list of banks to connect with. Ummm, doesn't that already make Plaid a better fintech company? The real kicker is ML USES PLAID when you originally choose the funding account you can never change.\nFourthly, the actual bank that ML uses is Lincoln Savings Bank. Guess who IS in the list of connectable banks in Plaid's lists? Yes - Lincoln Savings Bank! Awesome, right? Well, it would be if ML and LSB were in any way connected.\nFifth - let's talk about the terrible customer service. If you are ever lucky enough to get a hold of anyone on the phone number they list, the people barely speak English, they have no record of anything that has happened in your account and they have obviously never used ML. \nSo, is Moneylion on the up and up? I'm not even going to get into the practically useless loans with rates that are insane, or the idiotic monthly fee you have to pay to even have access to the loans - I've never even been able to GET a loan outside of $150 \"instacash\" loan that is about as advance payday loan-y as you can get without actually being called a payday loan. \nIf I haven't talked you out of using this place, PLEASE DON'T USE IT. You will regret it.",
