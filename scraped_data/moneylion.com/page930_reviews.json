            "message": "Hi there, Cass. Thank you so much for this awesome 5-star review! We're happy to know that our 0% APR InstaCash is to provide assistance and help you with securing that financial stability! It’s members like you that help makes MoneyLion ROAR! Additionally, the amount of Instacash you are eligible to receive is based on a variety of factors, including your MoneyLion account history, deposit and spending activity, repayment history, and other risk-based factors, as determined by MoneyLion in its sole discretion, and may change from time to time. Therefore, demonstrating consistent direct deposits and on-time payments can increase your Instacash eligibility, while a negative change in these factors could lower your Instacash eligibility. One of the best ways to ensure higher amounts of Instacash is connecting your direct deposits to a RoarMoney account. The same direct deposit when detected in RoarMoney (vs. an external bank account) will unlock TWICE the Instacash Given you’ve expressed a positive experience with MoneyLion, would you be open to also sharing this review on other review sites, including Google Play, Apple Store, BBB, and Wallethub? Thanks again for being the best part of the MoneyLion.",

I filed a dispute and the dispute team basically said that because the dispute wasn’t filed sooner for fraudulent charges I didn’t make I couldn’t get my money back or a credit for those charges, even when I filed the dispute the same day I noticed those charges. On top of all that every time I pay off my loan MoneyLion negatively reports that to my credit, so it hurts my credit every time. I used to recommend MoneyLion to people but after all the s-hit I’ve been through dealing with MoneyLion the past 2 years on top of being the only bank I keep my money, I’m about done and wouldn’t recommend MoneyLion to anyone. I needed my funds from my dispute and my instacash the most while I was in Ny with my family for my daughters birthday and I thought moneylion would’ve resolved my issue before her birthday, I was calling literally everyday and no one helped at all. At this point as soon as I get some extra money I’m just gonna go to a different bank. At first I thought MoneyLion was better than most banks but as time went on I realized that I was wrong. I’ve been through way too much stress dealing with MoneyLion than I ever had with any other bank and you guys are about to lose the most loyal customer because of all that you put me through.",
