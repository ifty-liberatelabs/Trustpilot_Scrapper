However I always have the peace of mind knowing if I need it, money lion is here to help. You get the money instantly, they don’t charge except to get the money instantly, you can choose to tip or not, but I tip every time I can because like they say, it helps money lion stay free. It’s a good app, works well & offers so many other features. I’ve tried Dave, earnin, Albert, and I will ALWAAAAYS recommend money lion. They suck in my opinion compared to money lion. I do well being a single mom and providing for my kids solely on me, but I do it to the best of my ability. So, thank you money lion, for being there when my kids & I needed help.",
