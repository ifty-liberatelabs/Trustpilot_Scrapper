I was also only allowed to get $50  though it said I had $75 available .I would have used MoneyLion for my direct deposits, but when I tried , they said instacash could not be used if Money Lion is where I chose to have my deposits sent. In addition, all of my member fees are paid up to date and I had gotten the $500 secured loan that I have put a lot of money into. However, the loan says it is complete, yet it was never put into my account and you cannot just keep all of the money that I put into that secured loan. So again, where is either my loan or all the money that I put into the loan month after month?\nUPDATE: I reached out to Money Lion on my own , again, this time , only to find another issue. I use their instacash , which is a nice feature , however; I paid it back 2 days early and then they tried to charge me again on the actual due date. Now, correct me if I am wrong, but paying tour Bills early is never a bad thing, but in this case, I suppose I should have waited until the exact due date because now they have me down as a missed monthly payment. As for the loan issue that I had spoken about previously,  I was told that because of a missed payment, they turned me into collections and used the money that I had invested into the $500 credit builder loan to basically pay for them taking it to collections ..... yes, over 1 payment. Now, I am being told that some of the almost $500 that I paid into a credit builder loan (to help my credit) now is charged off and I will receive a small portion of everything that I paid in back, within 3 to 5 days. So, well over $400 invested to hurt my credit and only recieve a small portion (what it didn't cost them to immediately send me to collecrions) back. Wow,  thank you. I put over $400 into a credit builder loan, it hurt my credit, and now I may recieve a portion of what I invested back. And don't forget, do not pay your payments early, because you will be reported for non payment when it isn't paid on the exact due date. Does this place have new management , as it actually was a great place to bank and build credit. I will update again and let you guys know if they do actually correct the reported non payment that was just played early and whether or not I actually recieve any of the $171 (of the $400 I invested) that I was promised would be returned within 3 to 5 days . Stay tuned, I will update as soon as the 5th day and we are already at 3.",
