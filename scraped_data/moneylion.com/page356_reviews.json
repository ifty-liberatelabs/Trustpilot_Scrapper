        "text": "On 10/20 I requested $400 be withdrawn from checking to go to external account. I knew it would take 24 hours so I waited. On 10/21 I looked on account and saw that it was in some investment account with moneyloin. I immediately called customer service and was quickly given excuses as to why my funds could not be refunded immediately. I had taken out a loan but paid it back and I had another pending transaction that was not due until next paycheck. I was told by the representative that I would have to pay additional money to pay off the loan that was not due until next pay date. I explained to her that it could be taken out of the $200 that was in the account if that was the hold up. I then questioned how my money got into this investment account that I never set up never put money into and never authorized. She told me the account was set when I opened checking. With this company I only asked for checking. I proceeded to ask to speak to a manager. I am placed on hold long enough for them to talk and I get a call come through it’s the manager. He places me on hold to hang up with representative. Which immediately I found shaky. I mean I know it’s Covid but most big companies have switch boards. I spoke with him and while speaking with him we discovered low and behold this account I never set up had the same exact last for numbers as the external debit card I requested my funds to go to. He acknowledged he saw this but couldn’t do anything because it went to another company and that he would initiate a liquidation. I then said I didn’t want that and wanted refund. I requested the company that had my money contact. He then said sorry that’s all the information I have and pretty much told me they would have my mon for 5-7 business days but he would start process. Fast forward to 10/26. I kept checking the site and low and behold the withdrawal button that was grey was now lit up and I hit withdraw because I want my money. I then called and was told my withdrawal started 10/26 I then asked to speak to supervisor same thing got a call same guy. He tells me they started withdrawal 10/26 I then became angry and told him what he told me he then said I see you filed a complaint with BBB I said yes because you are withholding my funds and giving me the run around. He then became very dry and as before said I would have to wait. I later went on website and was able to see where they were at which was the beginning. Now today I can’t see anything and I still do not have my money. They have put me in a major struggle with this and as soon as my funds are returned I’m closing this account and never coming back!",
