I am paying $100 a month since February.  Since the pandemic started, I've lost 20% of my pay and have had difficulty paying my bills, rent, food etc.  I've had to ask MoneyLion to defer my loan payments since I can't keep up, so they report me as late paying to the credit bureaus which isn't very helpful.  I've long since paid the $168 back but they will not let me out of this loan.  They are continually overdrawing my account and I have nothing good to say about this company.",
