        "text": "So you want to a MoneyLion Loan?\n\nWell.... you have to be a MoneyPlus member to get a loan, you are then required to pay $80 a month as a MoneyPlus member (a fee that is completely hidden by fancy info graphics and clever wording in the sign up process). \n\nHere's where they get sneaky. Once you get a loan, you must autopay the member fee of $80 in addition to a loan payment every month on time. Here's where they get even more sneaky. They say $50 of that fee goes into to your \"investment account\" (more on that later) claiming that you're actually saving money you only end up with $30 as a monthly fee (even though $80 in real money still leaves your bank every month)\n\nSo.....MoneyLion makes it even more convoluted by provide a service called an \"Investment Account\". They incentivize you to download their App and log in everyday for $1 (that goes into your investment account), thats around $30 a month. What a great deal right. Cause that covers the member fee... Right? WRONG\n\nYou do not gain access to the alleged \"Investment Account\" funds until the entire Loan is paid off. Which makes sense in most cases. But in with MoneyLion, by the time you end up paying off the loan with all your member fees attached.  \n\nThe BIG catch. Until your loan is paid off in full, none of the money in your \"investment account\" is available (Which makes sense). But all that cash MoneyLion \"saved and invested\" for you. Well, you get that once you've paid over $1000 annually between member fees and interest. \n\nMeanwhile your connected bank accounts are locked-in and membership cannot be canceled until you pay back everything. I'm not even sure thats legal. \n\nWHERE AM I SAVING ANYTHING?\n\nWith MoneyLion, you are joining an expensive monthly club. But the perks in this club... get small loan you can't payback, daily App tasks, fake invested money, false promises, no customer service, and really no services offered at all. Other than the little loan. \n\nCustomer service offers no flexibility and seems to have tricked me and many other people into this clever money scheme. \n\nOther then the short lived benefit of having the initial loan when I needed it. I feel bated into a long term trap meant for people in desperate times. People that need these kind of loans clearly cannot keep up with the fees and thus making MoneyLion and actually Lion and we're ll just prey.",
