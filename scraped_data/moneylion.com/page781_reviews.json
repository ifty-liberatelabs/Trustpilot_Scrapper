Money Lion responded to my truthful review with an oversimplified apology with the statement that they would contact me shortly.  That was over two business days and Money Lion has made no attempt to contact me.  At the same time I get daily messages from Money Lion that I should use my Instacash----which is still not an accurate amount due to their system flaws not recognizing my direct deposit which has not changed in 57 weeks. Money Lion is Clueless with a capital C.  They lost me as a customer, I stopped funding my investment account and the complex rules regarding how to close an investment account is like going to the dentist and having all of your teeth pulled without novacaine! Shame on you Money Lion! Your business practices are terrible, evidenced by the number of BBB complaints! You lost a customer because you cannot be relied upon!\nNote: After Money Lion posted their reply below, they said they provided me with $25.00 of reward points that could be redeemed and deposited in my investment account. Just another false statement! Close your eyes and what do you see?  Nothing? Exactly! The same as the $25.00 of reward points..... nowhere to be seen!\nI tried writing a third review but now Trustpilot seems to have the same system issues that money Lion has. The sad truth is money lion cannot be trusted!",
