We simply ask that you link your checking account in the MoneyLion app or dashboard, so we can review it for financial and other factors. If you qualify, you’ll receive a personalized loan offer up to $1,000. The offer will show you how much of your loan funds you’ll get right away and how much will be saved in a Credit Reserve Account and then given to you when you’ve paid your loan in full. This is to help you save while you build credit! \n\nYour Credit Reserve Account is an interest-bearing account maintained by MoneyLion’s SEC-registered investment advisor. If you default on your loan, your Credit Reserve Account may be liquidated to partially or fully pay off what you owe. If you have any more questions regarding the Credit Reserve Account, please contact us directly. We appreciate your feedback.",
