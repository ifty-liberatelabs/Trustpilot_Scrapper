Again I love this company and the fact that you can build your credit what I don’t like is that if you use instacash you get robbed money because of all the fees and a tip that you must agree to before you can borrow the money say you are approved to borrow $200 you have to make multiple transactions to get the $200 and you are charged a ridiculous fee and tip for every transaction!!!!

We created Instacash to help you access extra money to cover everyday essentials and unexpected expenses, and we designed it to be easy to pay back. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time.
