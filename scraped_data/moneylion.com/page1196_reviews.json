I expected to see the funds in my bank within a week as is the case with every other investment company. It is now October 10th and still no money and I have gotten the run around 3-4 times, insisting I call only to tell me they can't do anything and that I just need to wait. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy as even they shouldn't have to deal with this. Use another app where you will have access to your money quickly in the case of emergency like I wish I had done.\n\nUPDATE 10/11/2018\nAs MoneyLion requested below, I emailed them to resolve the problem as that is the easiest way to communicate for me and told them communicating via phone is not an option and I am not willing to wait on hold for 30 minutes again. The service rep replied by telling me they can't help me and to call after I specified I was not wasting time on the phone AGAIN. AGAIN they are giving me the runaround after trying to save their image by replying to my negative review. Stay away from this company.",

When you request to withdraw funds from your investment account it can take 7-10 business days for us to sell your investments and to transfer money via ACH to your bank account. If you withdraw money on a weekend or after trading markets are closed you'll need to wait until when the markets open again to sell your investments. For example: if you ask to withdraw money on a Friday afternoon we can only sell your investments at the earliest the following Monday morning. Your funds will then be transferred to you via ACH within a day after your investments sell. If you could please give us a call at 888-704-6970 or email us at support@moneylion.com.
