            "message": "Thank you for this positive review Neal! We created Instacash to help you access extra money to cover everyday essentials and unexpected expenses, and we designed it to be easy to pay back. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time. Tipping is optional, and whether you choose to tip doesn’t affect your eligibility in any way. Pay what you think is fair, or don't pay at all, it's up to you. Just be sure to read the screens and make your selections carefully, and you can use Instacash without tips or fees if you choose. That said, if you choose to leave a tip — thank you! It helps us cover the costs of providing 0% APR cash advance to many, many folks like you! We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly.",

        "text": "I've used multiple Apps similar to MoneyLion, at least for android devices, and they're excellent. They don't judge you if you use Chime or other Banks of the future, which is unlike Klover, Brigit, FloatMe, and Earnin. Even though I've gotten consistent paychecks of around $1,000 for a year into my Chime account I wasn't allowed to use these other Apps. I'm all the better for it because MoneyLion absolutely offered the most and it was around $200 extra for a pay period if I needed the help. They also offer a debit card, but I'm not getting my paychecks deposited into this account as of now, but if I did I'd be confident doing so was safe and would save on fees. It's sad because other Apps are losing my business and I won't use them. Dave, Cleo, and Branch are also good options and I've used them all. They don't offer as much as MoneyLion, but at least they're there for me if I need it. I think that you'll find any of those Apps as well as MoneyLion helpful when you're in need and if you don't pay for instant deposit or a tip, both of which are optional, then you are getting a fee free advance. They have to make money so I'll usually tip $2 for an advance, but not having to sucks. I don't like having to pay for instant deposit, but they have to make their money one way or another. Still, they're honest and upfront about the advances and I highly recommend trying them if you need a hand between paychecks. They've been good to me and I'm getting in the habit of leaving good reviews more rather than one bad ones when an App is awful. Give them a try! They're legit and you'll be happy.",

We created Instacash to help you access extra money to cover everyday essentials and unexpected expenses, and we designed it to be easy to pay back. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly.",

When I called was told there was not a Kayla, then got another email from “Kayla” that said wait 3-5 business days. Still have not resolved any issues, just keep the deception going. It is sad because I thought they were a legit company. \nI used Money Lion twice- always paying the amount back on or before it was due. When I went to use it again they had lowered my limit by over $150. I called customer service to find out why. The agent said my direct deposit of my paycheck on Oct 15 wasn’t deposited- yet they show it being deposited and the amount in their app. They are deceitful/ not helpful.",
