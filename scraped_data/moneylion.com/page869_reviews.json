Now I’m gonna get started here because of the unpleasant experiences some months ago. I don’t owe them ANY money, just to be clear, and I haven’t owed them money for many months. There is a comment by MoneyLion/ meta bank/ whatever bank Omaha NE in my credit file.... but I haven’t read it~ anyways, Consumer finance protection bureau stuff here.  .... let me know if you wanna know more :) I’ve spent hours and hours and hours in good faith, polite, ethical behavior with this disaster of an operation. I truly hope they (Money lion, et al) recorded from every angle the chat bot interactions, the telephone calls, and emails as I worked to assure accurate documentation of transactions between MoneyLion products. So here I am, months after resolution of those problems, low and behold, I’m receiving pestilent emails from the useless gong-show stating I owe them on a instacash loan (?!) I don’t. This time ‘round tho, I told the screener bot / AI that I was satisfied- and voila , I get to leave a rate / feedback . The systems this company is using are a major risk to your money and time.",
