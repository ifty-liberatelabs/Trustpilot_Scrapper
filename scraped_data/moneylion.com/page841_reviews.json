I was charged $3.00 for no reason and I hadn’t taken out a loan at that point. #2 if you invest any money good luck getting it back! I tried withdrawing it and couldn’t. So I took out my loan amount and was told by customer service that I can’t withdraw investment funds if I had a loan out, I said well if moneylion had a let me take it out before I did the loan I wouldn’t have taken out the loan! Customer service agents are not very nice! And they start people off with a loan  amount and if you change banks they change your loan amount, even thought your first loan was paid off using the new account! Example: I was given $115 limit, I use it and paid back $132.00 then my loan amount went down to $25! That's not cool!",
