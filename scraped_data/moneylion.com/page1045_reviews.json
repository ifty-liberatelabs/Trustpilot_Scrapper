I get paid on the 15th and the last day of the month, and if one of those days falls on a weekend or holiday, they pay me the day before.   This NEVER FAILS to throw off the app, and it decides I don't have any \"qualifying income\" and cuts my available \"until payday\" loan amount by 2/3.  They also have trouble figuring the payback date for my loans, so i always have to call and ask them to change it.  ALSO, while I am at it, they claim my instacash loan can be directly deposited to my account using my atm/debit card instantly and FREE of charge, but have ALWAYS charged me 4.99 to do that.  This is unreasonably crazy in this day and age, so I reduce the amount of my \"tip\" by that amount, usually.\n\nFinally, one thing that REALLY chaps my drawers is that they only let you take money out in 50 dollar transactions, which besides being a huge pain in the butt (SIX transactions, if you want 300 dollars,  for example) causes them to beg for a new tip and a new 4.99 instant transfer fee with every 50 dollar chunk. \n\nThat said, it is a handy app to have...when it works and when you need it. ;)",
