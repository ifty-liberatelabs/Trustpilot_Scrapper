I seen this app and decided to give it a try and when I completed everything I was eligible for $50.00 off top. I know that's not alot but when you barely have any food and need personal items $50.00 could be a lot more than you had. So I was very very grateful for that money and so was my family. Once I paid it back that is when I noticed that my limit had gone up so long story short when I had no one to turn to I tried MoneyLion and they were there for us.",

I am on Disability benefits.\n\n Despite my long history of poor credit, Money Lion has given me a fresh start on rebuilding my credit. \n \nMoney Lion has granted me $150 interest-free loans per month for the past couple years.  It was not until just last year that the loans were boosted to $300 or even $325 on occasion. \n\nOne of the best perks I got from Money Lion was accruing points for repaying the loans on time.  When I got to enough points, I chose to get two $25 eBay gift cards from Money Lion and buy my first ChromeBook.\n\nI have not used all of the benefits that Money Lion has to offer yet, but learning as I go is a fun challenge.\n\nI look forward to being a happy member of Money Lion while I continue to rebuild credit and improve my credit score. It has gone up from 350 points to 540 points in about three years time.  Thank you for giving me a chance to better myself and grow!",
