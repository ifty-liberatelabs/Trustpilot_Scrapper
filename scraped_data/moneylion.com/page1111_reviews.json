Given you’ve expressed a positive experience with MoneyLion, would you be open to also sharing this review on other review sites, including Google Play, Apple Store, BBB, and Wallethub. Additionally, after you unlock Instacash, the exact amount you have available each Instacash cycle (typically time with your pay cycle) will be based on factors in your linked checking account, primarily whether we can detect recent qualifying income and are able to predict when you'll be able to repay your Instacash. If we detect recent qualifying income, you'll have access to up to $200 depending on the income amount. If we can't, you'll have access to a lower amount but not less than $25.

I submitted paper work through their app like directed , they did not send it to my employer in time to keep the employer from sending my direct deposit to the MoneyLion checking account so I called them today two days before the money is sent and asked if they could either let it go through one last time seeing as how the account is still open or if they could send it to the roar money account since it’s still an in house transfer within their bank and they are the ones making me switch in the first place every person I talked to(including 2 supervisors) gave me the same BS responses that were just read from a script. They refused to give first and last names due to protocol. Any company that can have your social and address and birthday but not give at least a last name of the SUPERVISOR on the phone with you is a scam. Then they tell me it will take them 7-10 days to send the money back to me the same money that took less than a second to go to them , that they couldn’t just put into the account that is linked to my name that they made me open instead of my already established MoneyLion checking . Oh to top it off , I don’t even know how I’m going to use the money when I do have it deposited because they haven’t sent me my debit card that I asked for a week ago",
