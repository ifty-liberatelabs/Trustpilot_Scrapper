I don’t feel I can provide a complete non-biased evaluation at this time. I will say for what I have been able to see and use I really like it.  It’s almost like a social platform for banking.

        "text": "Paid for credit builder plus and opened a RoarMoney account.  Have taken out a loan (with part of it in their \"escrow\") and have utilized Instacash.  Now that they are happily taking my money in monthly installment payments and subscriptions, they decide they can't \"verify\" my identity so I can't actually access any of the perks I'm paying for.  I'm assuming this is due to the fact that they will not let me update my address, because I have to wait 30 days (even though I NEVER updated it - my account had been sitting opened and unused for years).  In addition to not being able to access perks I'm PAYING for, like Instacash, I can't even get a debit card sent to me to try to access the Lionshare bonus to cover the cost of my subscription.  And, to add insult to injury, the 30 days to update my address keeps moving - I contacted customer service on 2/27 and it was a little over a week into the 30 day period - when I contacted them today 3/8 - they told me it was now 30 days from 3/4.  So now something as simple as updating my address becomes an impossible moving target, meanwhile my account is useless while I wait.  This all feels like a scam, everything seems great at first and then once they have you, you suddenly don't have full access to your account.  I can't wait to pay off the loan ASAP and withdraw my money and close this account.  It's not worth the hassle, all because updating an address is apparently a chore.\nRun, don't walk, to get away from this company.",
