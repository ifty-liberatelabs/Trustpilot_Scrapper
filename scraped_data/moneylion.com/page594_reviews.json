        "text": "The customer service is deplorable bordering on fraudulent. I had a credit builder loan payment due on June 28th. I got paid on June 23rd and wanted to get all of my bills paid. I scheduled a payment. Suddenly it’s brought to my attention that my June Auto Payment was still scheduled to come out on June 28th automatically and the June payment I scheduled to pay early on June 23rd is scheduled to come out the next day on June 29th. When I spoke to customer service they told me they couldn’t cancel a pending payment. After it cleared my account is listed as past due. I paid my June 28th payment. I don’t understand how I can be past due when my next payment was due July 28th. Customer Service tells me that I have no payments scheduled for July. They say I had a payment due June 28th and 29th. Which is ridiculous. I looked over my loan agreement which clearly states 1 payment a month on the 28th. I can not be late for a payment that is not due for another 23 days from today. My instacash has been paused due to a missed payment that I didn’t miss. My good standing has been destroyed because I made a payment early NOT LATE early. There is literally no bank, heck there’s no good company in the world that wouldn’t correct this mistake in a second. It’s easy to see I did try to pay my July payment before my June payment. Agents are telling me I never had a July payment scheduled so they can’t change it. Again, my loan agreement states 1 payment due monthly on the 28th of the month. This is criminal. I will be contacting the BBB and my attorney if it’s not corrected.",
