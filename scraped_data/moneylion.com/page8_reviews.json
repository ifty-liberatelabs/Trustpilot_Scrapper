Every time I’ve needed to use their services, they are always reliable, and I can always depend on them for a payday advance. \n\nWhen I first started using them, I had trouble with their systems not verifying my license, but after quite some time of waiting, they finally verified my information and identity and allowed me to start using their Instacash service.\n\nI really appreciate MoneyLion and all of the assistance they provide to the people who use their services. There are a few trustworthy and dependable companies out there that you can get a quick cash advance or even a loan to build your credit from, and MoneyLion is definitely one of them. \n\nThanks, MoneyLion!",

I been a customer of MoneyLion for years and enjoyed their various products which include instacash (a cool feature to increase your cash flow) and 2 day early direct deposit. The reason for the one star is the dispute process which is very old fashioned and inconvenient to the customer. Imagine a scenario where you didn’t receive your Amazon goods where you spent hundreds or even thousands of hard earned dollars on. You go to the merchant and they can’t help you so you go to the only one you can trust , your card provider aka bank aka MoneyLion. Now you goto dispute and they tell you instead of receiving your provisional credit within hours like most banks do, that you have to wait 10 business days and if “qualified will receive your provisional credit back.” It was a let down hearing that but I waited patiently and the 10th business day comes I contact customer support for them to tell me they working on it and to mail them the dispute. Like what? Why you guys didn’t tell me prior to do that? And now they telling me it can take 90 days to receive it and provisional credits are not guaranteed. All around it sounds like a big red flag and I don’t like that. When people spend their hard earned dollars on something why you guys making the customer feel at fault and holding their money hostage? This is one of the worst experiences ever and I’m moving my direct deposit and will never invest in this business.",

I did but my account was still closed and no one reached back out to me ever. Even after sending a follow up email. I called today, 8 days later, and was told that the account is closed and he can’t give me any more information and any employee at the company is only able to give them that information.
