Fast forward I got my card, had one deposit used it once and now cannot access my funds. Money lion says it’s still active and ready to use however when I call the fraud department they say this card was deactivated BY MONEYLION for an unknown reason now I am again without access to my own hard earned money and have to wait for another card again!! When questioned as to why my card was deactivated in the first place the lady stopped the chat! And don’t bother calling the customer service number. Soon as you choose the option to speak with a representative YOURE DISCONNECTED! WORSE DECISION OF MY LIFE..",

You can view your progress in app. For Instacash, there is a $4-5 charge for money released instantly plus a tip. If you know you will need a little extra cash early enough, you can request the free method that takes up to 48 hours. Both methods have worked with no issues. I did note that each request must be made in $50 increments. So there is that $4-5 fee per each $50 plus tip for money right away.",
