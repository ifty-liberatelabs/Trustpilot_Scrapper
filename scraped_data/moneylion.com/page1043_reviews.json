        "text": "It’s very accommodating to have this option if needed. What I’m not crazy about is that when I use the instacash I usually don’t need it in 3-5 days so I get the instant method. It cost 5 bucks. I don’t think it costs anything for a company to send the loan immediately but then it seems like they’re shocked when I don’t leave a tip. I also am not crazy about having to pay twice because money lion only allows you to take up to 50.00 at a time. My limit is 90 so if I want the full 90 I have to take a 50 and a separate 40 and again if I borrow it’s usually because I need it at that time, not in a few days. I think it’s just a way to take more money in fees. If you give me a limit of 90$ let me take the whole 90$ or less if that’s what I want to do. I think it’s a little greedy. And honestly, I really try not to use this app because of the reasons previously stated. That being said, money lion has its flaws that I don’t like or agree with but it’s there when I need it. This is why I gave it 3 stars. I really don’t appreciate or agree with splitting up the amounts if you need more than 50$ it seems greedy and almost like they’re taking advantage of people they say they are there to help when needed but they get paid for really doing nothing but letting you borrow money in which you have to pay back within a week and a half. But I’ve deleted worse banking apps. Moneylion isn’t my favorite but it’s there if I really need it in these uncertain times but it does come at a price. Thanks for listening.",

I like that I can invest my money and use instant cash when I'm short on cash and I also have benefited from moneylion a whole lot and I like the APR is only  5.99% and how the payments to pay off my loan are affordable and I will recommend moneylion to friends, and family",
