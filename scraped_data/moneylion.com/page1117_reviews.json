Its a little off-putting to tell you the truth, but because of the \"instacash\"option, which i feel helps establish a more personal credit-type relationship between borrower/client and lender, i'll stick around, as Its saved my a** already on more than one occasion.  Support and trust like that from a bank or financial institute to a person in my situation is hard to find these days and i appreciate it.  I also appreciate the relevant yet not too overbearing partner ads.. Besides recoup they can prove to actually be useful to the  end user rather then just over inflate the click traffic solely for the developers profit margin... One day they'll be an honest, free, and truly helpful institution to hold and redistribute our money into the perpetuity that is capitalism, but until then i guess y'all stand with chime as the lesser of two evils.",
