This is my bank, I have no other bank to add and if I have to add another bank to my credit then I wouldn't need a money lion account and might as well close it. I missed several payments this way which only hurt my credit until after 4 chat attempts and 2 frustrating calls and after updating to the roar money account was i allowed to pay my loan payments. The chatbot should just have a live agent option when trying to get help along with the other options. Sometimes what I need is a simple question answered and the automated responses don't help in that case. Otherwise the moneylion concept is good, it's just the technical errors.",
