        "text": "COVID issues aside-as a money lender, try not to put expected dates of deposits for Instacash that are nowhere near accurate. I borrowed $50, twice within a couple of weeks of each other. I repayed my first loan on time and within a day, I received a notification that my repayment couldn’t be processed even though it had come out of my bank account and showed so on the MoneyLion app. That payment that “wasn’t received” then lowered my allowance for Instacash.\n\nOn top of that, MoneyLion shows expected due dates for Instacash deposits. I asked for a $35 deposit and a $10 deposit. Both were said to be deposited by the 14th. It’s now the 17th and I have yet to see the money. What is the point of being a “last minute” lender if you’re making people wait 7+ days for less than $40, IF they even receive it?\n\nAnother issue with this entire idea is that if you have any questions or immediate concerns, you’re placed on a waiting list about 20-25 minutes long-and you can’t even navigate away from the page/app or you lose your place in line. Once I finally got ahold of a customer service rep, they confirmed the app wasn’t accurate and that I’d see my money within a few days (again, the expected date on the app was way off). I then received that deposit an hour after asking for help-which makes me think they knew they messed up.\n\nThis app was a bad investment and after I repay the money I NEVER received (only because seeking help is apparently incredibly hard to do), I’ll be deleting the app and recommending nobody else rely on it in the way I did (only because it advertised such great help). It’s hard times right now and it’s upsetting to have to borrow a terribly small amount of money as is-but at least make it worth the shame.",
