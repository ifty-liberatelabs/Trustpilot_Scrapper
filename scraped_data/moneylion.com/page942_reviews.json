The only reason for me enrolling was have my instacash payments posted to my credit report. Now I don't have access to the credit I truly deserve, because of account reset my direct deposit history is gone so therefore I don't have access to higher instacash limit. Basically Screwed over for a 1160 that I don't get to use. Is it really a loan??? Sounds suspicious this is a preditory service at best.",

Moneylion has successfully created extreme financial hardship and continues to play the \" there's nothing i can do \" card. \nI decided to take advantage of the credit builder plus loan offer. I have always been able to make my membership payment via debit card for my moneylion checking account with no issues until recently when they said its no longer allowed. I only have 1 bank and that's with moneylion. In the past customer service has been able to process the member payments for me when I had issues using features like instacash. Now however they tell me that they aren't able to.\nThe major problem I have started on Oct. 1st \nWhen I called in and paid off my credit builder plus loan. The lady I spoke to assured me that once my payment processed that my loan would immediately be deposited into my roar account. \nThat didn't happen, instead the following week when I still didn't have the loan I called and was told it was being held due to a missed membership payment in June. Keep in mind its October and I've been able to use features like Instacash consistently every 2 weeks with no problems. How is there a missed payment in June all of a sudden.  I try to pay it using my roar account and it doesn't work. They say they sent in a service ticket and should be fixed in 1-3 days.  It wasn't. I've contacted moneylion support over 15 times in a span of a week and was told that they don't have a time frame to when this problem will be fixed and no time frame to when my loan will be released to me. \nI am now 13 days behind on rent and a car payment,  there's no customer service there's never anyone with any knowledge or authority to speak to.  Moneylion has done nothing to fix this problem or offered any type of solution. All i get is more lies, misinformation and continued worsening my financial situation. \nMy loan is paid in full. I have money in my roar account to pay the random June membership payment. Yet NO ONE has the ability to process the payment and release my funds.  \nAbsolutely no care for customers\nAbsolutely no regard for damages they cause \nAbsolutely no sense of urgency to resolve this.\n\nYeah great send me the link to the complaint form that I've already filled out twice, claim you'll contact me directly.  When? Next week. Or do I need to file 3 before I get service? Can't locate my account.  Thats a load of bs. My email is linked to my account.  You see my full name.   Pathetic excuses.",
