The Instacash feature is icing on the cake that has been extremely helpful to me on numerous occasions. Even moreso, because it's free. There is an option to \"tip\" for service, which I always choose to do, but isn't required. I also love the Shake n Bake rewards. It's basically a cash-back feature...you make a purchase or payment using your MoneyLion Roar account/card and a few days later you get to \"shake\" your phone to see how much of the purchase amount you receive back. This amount is deposited directly into your investment account. This makes it a great way to contribute to your financial wellbeing and future for basically doing the things you would do anyway. And, on the couple of occasions that I did require help from customer service (because of errors on my part), they were prompt with their attention, helpful and friendly. I am so glad that I chose to become a MoneyLion. Easily, one of the best decisions I've made all year.",
