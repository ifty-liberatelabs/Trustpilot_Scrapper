I called customer service and they told me my account was under review and then they wouldn't even give me a reason why it was under review. When I kept trying to ask why she just kept saying it's a policy review which she couldn't even explain to me. So I changed my direct deposit to another account and today I don't get paid but I have my paystub saying my check when into the money lion account still and I still can not access my account and it is telling me that my check is not there when my paycheck stub clearly states that it was deposited into my money lion account and I just have no way of accessing it for 5-7 days but it's ridiculous because I want me check when I'm supposed to be paid. I'm beyond heated with this company and I advice everyone to not use this company.",

But they reported to the credit bureaus that I've never made a payment.  I tried to pay off my balance last month (which was much higher than my original loan amount), but they wouldn't allow me to pay it online.  I called and couldn't get a live person to talk to.  I sent a message through their app, and it said I'd hear from them within 24 hours.  They didn't call back until 3 weeks later, at which time my pay-off amount was even higher, even though I had made 2 payments since I tried to contact them 3 weeks earlier.  \nTheir interest rates are extremely high, and you only pay on the interest first, so your pay-off will always be higher than the amount you borrowed.",

I have tried calling customer service for over 6 months to try to solve this issue. I always get the same message that call volume is high and they will call back. I have never received a call back.  \nThe Instacash option is nice, but they have double the cost to use it.\nAnd God forbid you have a problem. My debit card was stolen. I was able to immediately lock the card from the app, which is a nice feature, but it will take 7 to 10 business days to get a new card.  There is no way to access the money in my account as there is no way to do an external transfer.  I have tried contacting customer service by phone, email and by the automated forms and have not gotten a response.  \nMoneylion is great if you have extra money or want to use the investment account, but otherwise like every other bank they take your money and don't care about their customers.\n**update** I have attempted to close my account with Moneylion.  I have gotten an email that my account is closed and I cannot access most of my account, but they have not released my money.  I still cannot get a hold of anyone in customer service, although I did receive a message from a supervisor in regard to a review that I gave them. The number that was left for me to call them back was the same number I have been calling 10+ times a day for a week that either hangs up on me, wants me to take a survey on their customer service (surprise! It was not a good review) or they promise to call back but never do.",

I have complained several times about payments made on my MoneyLion loan tagged ”in-process” for several days, though it cleared on my bank statement. When MoneyLion reported me to the credit bureaus 30 days late I was furious! I contacted customer support and was told ”If you see any inaccurate information on your credit report, you must dispute it with the Credit bureaus” so I did. 30 days later MoneyLion reported the same loan as 90 days past due!  I have proof that my payments were withdrawn from my bank account on time !Additionally, payments I made to the membership/ investment took over 3 weeks to appear on my account. I need this corrected now! Several complaints I've seen all over the internet with this company. I will continue to report this corporation in the hope that no one else gets financially ruined.\nUpdate 9/9/19\nFinally talked to someone after 3 days . I discussed my grievances with Ms.Kinnbah ,who seemed sympathetic. She redirected my statement to another department and I’m told I can expect a response within 10-14 days!!!!\nI guess I have to wait AGAIN!",

I paid my loan off in full last week and yet the payment STILL says processing after five days which is stopping me from withdrawing my $700 worth of investment funds they are holding. I don’t understand why it is so hard to get MY money back. I have to wait an hour and 30 mins to reach someone in customer service which is ridiculous. I have filed a complaint with the BBB and regret ever signing up for services with this company. Customer service is poor and any small inconvenience is like pulling teeth to get fixed. I would not sign up unless you really don’t care what happens to your money.",
