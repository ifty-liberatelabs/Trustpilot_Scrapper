We created Instacash to help you access extra money to cover everyday essentials and unexpected expenses, and we designed it to be easy to pay back. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advance of $50 at a time. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly.",
