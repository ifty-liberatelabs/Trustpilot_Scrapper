I have a issue that requires a manager to speak with you, so I called and waited 1st time 47mins and then they answered and call was poor and they hung up. 2nd called back they had me on hold for a hour 47 and they had the associate come on and say no manager is available. \n3rd i called back that following week, the associate could not help and once again was going to transfer me.. this time I said have your manger call me back. No call till this day, \nCalled last Tuesday same process , and still no call yet from a manager. \n& today I am trying to talk to a manager once again & currently been on hold for 2hours & 12 mins .\n( & mind you their automated service keeps saying one minute) \n\nI believe this is the worst custom service I’ve had to deal with, in the time that we are in I just would like to understand what is going on with my account to help with bills. \nI have had a account for 8 months and have had no issues, but after me not even being able to get a simple answer to my account (that I pay 19.99) a month for , I believe I will not use them anymore. \nif you have a issue , you are better off canceling because they will not help.",

MoneyLion choosing to switch over to RoarMoney has been a complete downgrade since RoarMoney acts more like a prepaid checking account service it’s similar to prepaid accounts such as (example: Netspend, rushcard, or evening direct express) RoarMoney holds bk value of a traditional checking account and doesn’t get looked at as a traditional checking account like MoneyLion. I have been banking with MoneyLion for over 2 years and because of this switch and the horrible customer service i will be changing banks.",
