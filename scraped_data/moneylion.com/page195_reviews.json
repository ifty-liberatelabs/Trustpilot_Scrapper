I recieved an email that they were making changes to thier system, I was to get direct deposit that same week. I checked in the moring and the deposit was not in my account. I chatted with a customer service rep who was no halp at all. All the person would say was \"They do not detect a direct deposit to my account\". I checked with my employer, who put me in contact with their bank. I was told the deposit was transmitted and acknowledged by the recieving bank. I got back on chat with a service rep from Money Lion, was told the same thing, \"The do not detect a direct deposit to my account\". This went on all day with them, They told me some one would call me, this never happened. The direct deposit showed up after 4:00pm....\n\nToday, I tried to add my new bank to the wallet, the service to get a quick loan between paydays seemed like a good idea. Again, met with more problems... I added the account, it showed up in my wallet, but didn't show up on the roar money side. I again got on chat, they wanted me to give them my bank account number over text,  told them no, I had added it through the plaid system, then they wanted me to delete my app and check again. Seriously, they have the worse informed customer service I have ever used. I ended up canceling my account and service.",

        "text": "I'm leaving my feedback for a money lending app/Money Lion, that is user friendly for the most part. There are pros and cons, but if you need money to help you stay afloat until payday, this is the app for you! You are asked to give a \"tip\" for the lending services and charged a fee for instant same day transfer of money. It literally happens right away with this option. You can of course, do the option of 5 to 7 business days for no fee. If you decide that same day is a must, you could borrow up to 100.00 for 11.99. Your total amount of money to borrow could be much larger than the amount you're allowed to borrow at one time. You could be approved for up to $300 to borrow, but the app allows you to borrow $20.00 to $100 at a time. Giving a $4.00 \"tip\" and charging you a instacash fee of $7.99. Once ML is linked to your bank account, it can predetermine on your payday cycle that is reoccurring in history, when they could/can be repaid by you. It normally sets the repayment date for your next paycheck. If this doesn't work for you, you have the option of changing or moving this date around a little. It's never easy to borrow money, but it's a little easier when you are using an app that allows you to navigate what works best for you. Reminders and account information are on the app, it's not hard to use. The app can glitch sometimes and tell you that it's not connected to your bank account, but you can fix this easily. If you need money, give it a try...",
