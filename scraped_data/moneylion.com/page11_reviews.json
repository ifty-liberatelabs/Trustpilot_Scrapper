When I spoke with customer service they said they were sorry and that they take out money when they see a deposit. WTH? Why did you ask me when I get paid in the first place, didn‚Äôt I sign a contract stating truthfully when I get paid and when MoneyLion would deduct payments?? This is irresponsible of MoneyLion to just assume a large deposit is a paycheck and blame it on ‚Äúinconsistent paydays‚Äù. Yes they make up rules as they go. Then they lower the amount you can borrow so you can‚Äôt even help yourself even though you have paid them back!!!  So stupid.",

        "text": "If you had asked me yesterday how I felt about MoneyLion I would‚Äôve emphatically told you that I was happy, excited, optimistic about my financial future with them. They have tons of ways to invest, build your credit, apply for various loans, etc. But they also use those same lender finder companies to look for loan options so when you ‚Äúcheck your rate‚Äù they‚Äôre actually sending your info out to dozens of other lender finders and MAYBE an actual lender or two. At this point you can burn whatever email you signed up with because you will be inundated with CONSTANT loan offers that keep coming weeks after you first checked your rate. That‚Äôs just a minor annoyance compared to what they did that completely changed my mind about them. I had a large deposit that was being transferred from Bank of America into my RoarMoney checking account and it was taking forever, so I checked in daily with customer service. I spoke to 4 different people. The first 3 told me I just needed to wait til the end of the day and it should be in my account. The money was sitting in a queue where they could see it but I couldn‚Äôt see it pending in my account. For 3 days I am reassured that it‚Äôs going to be in my account and that it‚Äôs just fine. They were aware of the amount, the name of the person sending it, the other banks name, they knew everything. So today, after speaking to someone in customer service about the pending status and hearing ‚Äúend of day‚Äù again I was surprised to see that my checking account wouldn‚Äôt refresh when I checked the app a few hours later. I blamed it on my internet, but when it was still happening a while later I called customer service and asked for some clarification about the issue. He checks it out and proceeds to tell me that the account had been closed by MoneyLion due to suspicious activity and I was not eligible to reopen it‚Ä¶.wait, what? No phone call to v inquire about the transaction to see if it was me? They won‚Äôt even tell me if it actually involved a transaction. I know absolute nothing about the cause of the closure. They told me two things: ‚Äúthat is all that I can tell you about it‚Äù and ‚Äúthey reference the agreement you signed when you got the account‚Äù. When has your bank ever just shut down your account PERMANENTLY because they flagged an outlier transaction in your account? I had just put that account information on my direct deposit info for the job I‚Äôm starting next week. I have invested in Bitcoin, and several stock options, spread my money all throughout the app because u thought that they would do right by me. I was wrong. There was nothing offered but a meek apology from the customer service guy and when I asked to speak to someone in management he just told me that they don‚Äôt have the ability to overturn it. Ummmm, sir‚Ä¶.the only thing I want overturned at this point is the establishment‚Äôs reputation üôÑ on top of everything, they waited 3 days while the money was pending and just rejected it today. There was absolutely no attempt to reach out to me before they axed the account. I‚Äôm frustrated and angry and so annoyed because I don‚Äôt have time to deal with this unnecessary bs. I‚Äôm a single mom if 3 kids working 60+ hours a week just trying to get myself financially fit and if that is your goal too then I suggest you look elsewhere because MoneyLion does shady business. I‚Äôm just hoping that ‚Äòrejected‚Äô transfer gets back to the right place. Try out Kikoff for credit repair and Stash for your investment endeavors and don‚Äôt give these jokers your money or your trust.\neta: I was told I‚Äôd have access to everything but the checking account and I am now locked out of my entire account meaning they‚Äôre stealing not just my checking account balance but also all of my investments. What do I do???",
