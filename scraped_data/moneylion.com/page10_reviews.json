Then was told I need 3 deposits before it will find my income. You can literally see my direct deposit on their list of transactions from my bank being linked. You can also still see ALL of my direct deposits. I asked for a supervisor and was told that it would take 24-48 hours. They had no problem taking my money but now that I have an issue getting it back I am getting the runaround. I will be canceling them once this is resolved.

Spoke with an agent this morning who was no help, can’t get a straight answer other than it’s pending. Same BS, I’ll call you back which they never do, I paid the loan off April 21, and within 14 days per documentation my credit reserve balance of $700 was supposed to be deposited into my RoarMoney bank account. It’s been 3.5 weeks since I paid in full and now I’m told today it’s still in pending status, DoNotDo business with Money Lion, do your research, this has been a painful emotional process to deal with and still no answer, ridiculous. Shame on you Money Lion!!!!\n\nUPDATE 5/12-\nAs of today, money not deposited, called in and spoke to an agent who told me word for word same BS as previous 3 agents, now I’m told another 5-7 days, this is unacceptable. Something is not right, STAY AWAY from Credit Reserve Loans. I feel like it’s a scam, being lied to on a daily basis, can’t get a straight answer only agents reading a script, each time I’m told your money has been moved to an investment account and funds will be disbursed after process is complete. Reading my loan documents, funds should have been deposited into my account no later than 14 days after loan was paid off, now going past 3 weeks….have no choice but to seek legal help, this is complete misery.\n\nIf I could give a zero I would, what started off as a great experience has turned into a nightmare. I paid off a Credit Reserve loan April 21, and was per contract to be paid the $700 reserve into my Money Lion Roar Banking account within 14 days…as of this morning I still have not received it. I have called in numerous times and each time was told different days on when it would be paid. They claimed there was an internal issue and that the payment into my account was rejected and they had to escalate the issue. They make it up each time, this morning im told there was an issue with the algorithm internally which is why it was rejected…Really???? from my research it looks like what I  going thru has happened to thousands of people around the US. Extremely disappointed in their customer service, how do these service agents sleep at night knowing they are lying to people on a daily basis? I would not recommend Money Lion to anyone, stay away.",
