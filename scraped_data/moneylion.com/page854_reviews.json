        "text": "MoneyLion has been a part of my financial portfolio now for a little over a year and in that time I have found them to be both extremely useful to my own financial growth while providing the flexibility that has been an absolute necessity during these trying times. I have no complaints whatsoever regarding any product, service, or customer service contact that I have made with them. They provide a wide variety of products to encourage financial diversity as well as the education and support to maximize their potential and benefit to their customers. The services they provide are well thought out, easy to use, transparent in terms, and also beneficial to my personal financial growth. Their customer service is always prompt, knowledgeable, friendly, and professional and they never fail to give their full attention to whatever need that may arise and are efficient and reliable and quick to remedy any concern you may have. I would highly recommend MoneyLion to anyone, from those just starting out in their financial journey, to the most seasoned of investors as there is a place for everyone with this bank.",
