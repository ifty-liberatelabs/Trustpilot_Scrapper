        "text": "There are still a lot of bugs that they need to worked out with this company.I like the new RoarMoney idea and concept but I wonder if the reason they have so many glitches and issues is that they start rolling out new things before they’ve mastered the original concepts. \n\nFor example, I have been trying for almost 2 years now to have a closed bank account removed from my account as my primary funding source. I’ve tried calling every # I can fine and get very little help over the phone, if any. Trying to email someone doesn’t get you anywhere because all they do is keep asking for documentation over and over until the conversation just kind of dies. Frequently asked questions are not helpful and I’ve spent hours reading through every FAQ in the app/site to fix this problem. Yesterday I filled out one of the new forms they added to have the account removed by the options that they give you to request removing an account don’t fit anything. I closed the account in question 2 years ago... It don’t get much simpler than that.\n\nPlus I’ve lost $100 out of my investment to that closed account because I was trying to cash out $100 into my MoneyLion account and right when I clicked on the button to put it into my ML checking the app glitches and shut down. So I opened it back up and went back to the transfer area and found that when it glitched somehow it still read that there was going to be transferred but it put it to my closed bank account. Spent hours trying to figure out how to get that canceled or stopped because of no one was available over the phone and all I could do is leave messages. I sent emails I sent chat messages I read ours an hours of frequently asked questions and nothing. I’ve never gotten assistance with that and I have never gotten that money back. It’s just gone.\n\nAlso don’t like that the Instacash doesn’t let you choose I tip amount other than what’s preset. I also noticed that they changed it to where you can only get up to 50 at a time and every single time they want you to tip them. So in the end you end up paying them a lot of money to get the Insta cash even though it’s supposed to be 0% interest. That’s part of the fine print I guess.\n\nSo, while they have great ideas of banking, investing, lending and saving, they need to make things that should be easy, like removing a closed bank account, easy.",

            "message": "Hi there, Chris! We appreciate your feedback so we can continue to improve our products and services. To provide better information, for starters, you do get a loan up to $1000 with Credit Builder Plus, however, depending on your finances, we may save a portion of your loan in a Credit Reserve Account in your name to help you save while you build credit. You'll get access to those funds to spend on whatever you want as soon as you pay your loan in full. That money is still yours and it’s our way of helping you borrow, save, and build credit. You have two options for using the money in your Credit Reserve Account. You can make your regularly scheduled payments on the loan until it is paid off. As soon as it’s paid off, the funds from your Credit Reserve Account will be sent to your checking account for you to enjoy. Alternatively, you can use your Credit Reserve Account money to help pay off your loan in full at any time. To be clear, you can’t use your Reserve Account money to make loan payments; you can only use it to pay off your loan in full. Additionally, we would like to thank you for the positive review. It’s members like you that help make MoneyLion ROAR! Given you’ve expressed a positive experience with MoneyLion, would you be open to also sharing this review on other review sites, including Google Play, Apple Store, BBB, and Wallethub. Thanks again for being the best part of MoneyLion!",
