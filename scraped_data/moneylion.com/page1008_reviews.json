            "message": "Hi there, Brittney! Thank you so much for this awesome review! We're happy to know that our 0% APR InstaCash was able to provide assistance to you! It’s members like you that help make MoneyLion ROAR! Additionally, we want to inform you that the amount of Instacash you are eligible to receive is based on a variety of factors, including your MoneyLion account history, deposit and spending activity, repayment history, and other risk-based factors, as determined by MoneyLion in its sole discretion, and may change from time to time. Therefore, demonstrating consistent direct deposits and on-time payments can increase your Instacash eligibility, while a negative change in these factors could lower your Instacash eligibility. One of the best ways to ensure higher amounts of Instacash is connecting your direct deposits to a RoarMoney account. The same direct deposit when detected in RoarMoney (vs. an external bank account) will unlock TWICE the Instacash. You will always be informed of your current available Instacash amount in the MoneyLion mobile app. Given you’ve expressed a positive experience with MoneyLion, would you be open to also sharing this review on other review sites, including Google Play, Apple Store, BBB, and Wallethub. Thanks again for being the best part of MoneyLion!",
