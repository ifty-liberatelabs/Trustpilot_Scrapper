My stimulus check was rejected. I haven't been able to use by debit card at the ATM ever, my card declines transactions frequently. I would have closed this account but my stimulus payment was being deposited and the IRS said if I closed it I may not get it until June. Go Figure. MoneyLion is a big deception!

I've seen no change in scores, and I've checked my reports, they are not reporting.\n\n2 - I called them to have my bank account information changed so they could take the usual monthly payment. I was assured over the phone the upcoming payment would be removed from the new account. Instead they took it from wrong account and overdrafted my account.\n\nWhen I contacted them I was told that it takes 2 -3 days for those changes to go through and because of that, they weren't going to credit me the NSF. \n\nWhen I explained that the rep I spoke to AND the documentation on their website did not indicate this, they thanked me for the feedback and still refused to credit the NSF fee. I'm now out $70 in the middle of a pandemic when money is incredibly tight because of a lack of communication. Beyond furious.\n\n3 - Their $20 membership fee is BS and pretty much a money grab. There is nothing inside of the moneylion app that will help you that you can't get from a site like WalletHub or Credit Karma. \n\nSo to recap the credit building is a lie. Membership fees are a scam. They're are greedy as hell and refuse to simply do the right hing based on a mistake THEY MADE.\n\nIf you need quick cash use an app like DAVE. Dave is wonderful! Moneylion is a joke.I was in a desperate situation and needed the cash and I regret this deeply. Don't make my mistake, DO NOT USE MONEYLION.",

        "text": "This is my first time writing a review, so this is serious. I am livid! I took out a $500 credit builder loan with MoneyLion In November. $125 was deposited into my account. I set up automatic payments so I would never miss a payment and all payments would be in time. They took out $9.91/week for the loan, as well as $4.90/week for the membership from my bank account. I tried to pay it off in February, something went wrong because they never initiated the transaction. I had over $3000 in my account, there shouldn’t have been an issue, but ok. I figured I’d just continue with the weekly payments because it's helping with my credit, right? After the failed payoff, I received notifications from my bank like clockwork every Friday that a payment has been transferred to MoneyLion. I thought everything was fine, Up until 4/11/2020 when I received a credit monitoring notification that my payment was over 30 DAY LATE!!! I opened the app and sure enough, no loan payment was taken out after the failed payoff payment. I called customer care to see what was going on. They said that the failed payment canceled the automatic payment. Those payments were for the membership only. Are you freakin’ kidding me?! WELL, WHY THE HECK  DIDN’T MONEYLION SEND ME A FREAKIN’ NOTIFICATION?!?! HOW THE F*$k AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT?!?! Send a notification, an email, a letter, SOMETHING letting me know what was going on. Again, I set all my bills on automatic payment because I don’t want to miss or be late with my payments. I’m trying to build my credit not destroy it. Up until then, my payment history was 100% with no derogatory marks on my credit report, now my credit score took a hit with from this fiasco. I said F*$k it, I’m paying this off, I need to be done with MoneyLion. I paid it off on 4/11/2020, they took the money out of my account on 4/14/2020. I called customer care to see why my money wasn’t released from escrow, they said that it takes 5 days to process. Then an extra 5 days for me to transfer it to my bank account...Seriously?! That’s bulls*$t! Why do I have to wait 10 days to get my money?! I can’t even cancel my membership because my loan “Isn’t paid off”, even though they took the money from my account. I just want to be done with them. STAY AWAY FROM MONEYLION!!!! \n\nQuick note for MoneyLion: Inform your customers if a payment is late or missed. You’re supposed to help build credit, not destroy it. Had it not been for my credit monitoring notification I wouldn’t have known about the missed payments. Also, let the customer know that if they try to pay off the loan and their payment doesn’t go through, that it would cancel automatic loan payments.",

Still waiting for a deposit of 75 to my account from the beginning of March and they took 82 (includes a tip I was happy to give at the time) from my account. I’ve gotten nothing but excuses and 6, SIX different people to deal with on this matter. I’ve asked for a resolution numerous times and now have involved a lawyer. I will guarantee that they will respond to this message because of it’s negative nature and then will proceed to open yet another ticket which they will close on their own. Each time I get no response from this company I post a well deserved negative comment and they respond with apologies and we start the whole thing over again from the start. I’m done. Time to bring this company down!",
