Well that must be how they get ya. Cause as soon as i did that my instacash limit went down to 50 dollars. The only thing that had changed is my income had increased by 250 dollars a month. So now i pay 20 a month in membership fees plus tip for basically 30 a month advance. I contacted customer service they said the would look into it. I never heard anything back and nothing changed.",

        "text": "I enjoy using Money Lion, I haven’t had any major issues with it.\nIt’s pretty easy to use with no major kinks to report.\nThe only reason why I’m not giving it a 5 star review is for 2 reasons.\n1. Instacash advances are only available in increments of 50.\n2. If you wish to use instacash you have to tip every time.\n\nThere is still a fee if you wish to have the money expedited (which most people do).\nTherefore the tip on top of a fee seem a little silly to me. Charge either a tip or a fee but not both. My opinion. If you don’t tip they try to make you feel bad by pointing out that you didn’t tip. \n\nOther than these things I find the app and the service pretty good and easy to use.",
