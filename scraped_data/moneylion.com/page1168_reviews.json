If your previous membership payment was for $79, we would like to inform you that the $50 of that payment was saved towards your Investment Fund which you can withdraw through the mobile application and would be disbursed through the bank account that you've selected. The remaining $29 was for your membership. Now, with Credit Builder Plus membership, customers are only paying $19.99 per month (plus your loan payment) and they can take advantage of the following: A low APR Credit Builder Loan – You'll receive up to $1,000 in your checking account as soon as you qualify. Depending on your finances, we may save a portion of your loan in a Credit Reserve Account in your name to help you save while you build credit. You'll get access to those funds to spend on whatever you want as soon as you pay your loan in full. Credit building and reporting – We report your loan payments to all three credit bureaus to help you build credit, and you'll get weekly credit score updates in the app track your progress. 0% APR Instacash advances up to $50 per pay period any time day or night, and Monthly Lion’s Share Loyalty Program payouts up to $19.99!

However, the main issue with using and enjoying these services is that when issues arise, customer service is beyond terrible, which is most likely due to the MoneyLion operations.\n-\n To give examples that show an unbiased opinion, here are the timelines I've personally experienced since being a customer. Escalated issues take 3-5 business days (with no guarantee of follow-up), Withdrawals takes 7-10 business days, payments take 5-7 business days to post, phone support often takes at least 30 minutes of waiting on the phone, and e-mail support is often followed up with the same questions over and over without a qualified customer service representative that can figure out the issue on their own (no matter how much information you provide them). This has been a repeated issue and is a very valid reason why I'm hesitant and not likely to invest more time and money into anything MoneyLion offers. \n-\nIn addition to this, the app is always having issues and you can only use the app for most of the services.\n-\nAlso, my last escalated issue I found out was never send up by a supervisor named Jose, and I only found that out by calling back several days later and speaking to another supervisor named Edward when my original issue was not addressed.",
