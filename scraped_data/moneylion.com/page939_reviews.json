        "text": "So when I initially used money lion, it was a life saver. I didn't like the fact that I had to make several withdrawals as they only do increments of $50. I put a hefty tip on the first withdrawal and did not on the second. I paid both of those off as requested and required no problem. When I came back about a month later, I immediately got a message asking if I was happy with the service because I don't tip???? They actually sent me an email asking about a $3.00 tip. They even took it off of the newly borrowed $50. They had sent another email insinuating that it was a past debt that would keep me from borrowing. They keep trying to get me to get their card but it's a virtual card???? If you need $50 or less for a quick second but anything more they will force tips and take them. I'm waiting on my pay back so I can close my account all together. Yes I have proof of everything I am writing. Enjoy!\n\n10/23 In response to Money Lion, I normally tip every single time but I did 2 back to back withdrawls and tipped heafty on the first withdrawl. Everything was completely paid back. When I went to use your system again, Your company emailed me about not tipping the previous time and was specific in asking about $3.00 10/05. When my account was funding with the $50.00 requested from Money lion on the 6th. Yall took the $3.00. It was for a fee or previous balance owed. So you website says tip what you like and even has the option not to tip HOWEVER yall will take it anyway once you fund the new instacash out. I have proof of everything I am saying it you would like to see it. Please feel free to email me and get the information since you feel the need to response and defend yourself.Thankyou",

They’ve stuck with me, treated me and trust me. I trust them to. I’ve been building myself back up and all thanks to MoneyLion! This pandemic has been hard for everyone, and I’m more than thankful to MoneyLion. Literally without them I would have been in some tough spots of these weeks. I wish I had the vocabulary to properly thank them in the way that I feel. Right now THANK YOU in caps is how I’m feeling. Great app, great support team. I’ll keep them as long as they’re around\nMatthew Richitelli",
