You can't cancel if they haven't finished processing a payment, which, by the way, may take them up to 7 business days to do, so if you get payments taken from your account every 2 weeks, you've got a very small window in which you MIGHT be able to successfully cancel.  And even then, they take an incredibly long time to give you your money back.  Sure, they monitor credit and whatnot, but so do a lot of other apps that are a lot more user-friendly.  While they claim the $1/day for logging in is \"free money\" it's anything but.  Not only are you already paying them $30/month (and basically just getting your own money back), but you don't JUST have to log in.  You have to log in and swipe through all the little \"tip cards\" they've put there for you.  No, it's not a lot of work, but it's still a huge hassle and a little bit of false advertising.  The investment account isn't all that well performing either, so why would you even want to give them all of your money, have to log in every single day to get it back, not have any rights to get that money back out when you need it, and jump through a billion hoops to cancel when you've finally had enough of it?  No thanks.  Stay far, far away.",

Just clarification my account was not closed during the process it was closed over a month before I contacted and I had updated the info in the application before I cancelled. I also have 3 reps confirm the bank name and last 4 digits multiple times. Just wanted to clear that up. I am available anytime at 5PM CST\n***********************************************************************************\n\nI had a wonderful experience with the 500$ advanced loan feature. I would pay off and then be able to apply again and receive as needed. I never missed a payment and utilized the feature 5-6 times. I opted to invest in the investment account feature. After Trying to obtain funds in my account and being told multiple incorrect pieces of information on what the balance can have or when I can pull funds. I decided to pay off my last loan and liquidate my investment account with over 330$ dollars. I was told when I cancelled my membership on 7/6 I will received funds in 7-10 business days. I waited and called back 7/14 and was told the actual process had not be started yet but a manager would call me back because the process wasn't explained correctly to me. The funds were not liquidated until 7/16 and I had to call and confirm this as I was never called back my a manager, but again after the credit is sent to my account I would be called back to confirm. After each call the rep would then confirm my bank account name and last 4 digits. I then followed up the next week and spoke with a representative named ryan. I explained the situation was told he would get a supervisor on the phone and hung up on me. I called back and at this point I was directed to Michael a supervisor who directly oversees the liquidation and credit process. We spoke multiple times over the next week. He was apologetic polite and kept in communication with me. He even called back right away when our call was disconnected. Before we discovered an error in my banking as the previous reps had customarily done, he confirmed my bank name and last four of account number. I followed up on 7/24 at this point explaining to Michael I spoke with a representative at my bank who cannot find any amount from the company money lion, drive wealth or better cash. I then asked to confirm my entire bank account number instead of the last 4. At this point who gives me a different bank name and account that has been closed for 2 month that I had changed in the system and had confirmed with prior representatives. He also confirmed this same information on his outbound call he made to me when we disconnected. He then said he would pull call records and then I provided the correct bank information. He said that the transfer was complete which I said was not possible since the account is closed so the bank ach transfer is not complete. I gave my correct account information again. He apologized said he would call back. On 7/26 I received a voicemail, I called back and he said he will escalate and had no further information and will call 7/27. I called 7/27 and was told he was out of the office this day. I waited Monday 7/30 and received no call. I called back today at 7/31. At this point he said he pulled all of the calls him and I had and said that I \" threw him under the bus for making claims that never happened\" I was appalled I was being accused of lying. I told him it was not with every call that this occurred it was the multiple calls and associates that they confirm my bank name and last 4 digits. He kept implying I was lying and that he cannot assist me I had to retrieve the funds from chase. Chase account is closed. The funds have not been sent anywhere. I advised this has been almost a month and would expect a resolution. He continued to imply with statements of I gave incorrect information or I am not correct, essentially stating I am lying. I asked to speak with someone above him, he actually refused and said he would not get me over to anyone else. I asked again to speak with a VP or director and he denied me. I asked if he pulled all my previous calls his response was \"I pulled all the calls I thought were important\". I asked to review those calls as you are recording me with my permission I can listen. He refused again. I asked one more time to speak with the other supervisor in the same department and he hung up on me. I have been patient for 4 weeks. I have been ignored, hung up on multiple times, I have been polite and kind and understanding. Only this most recent call was my voice elevated but I still referred to Michael as sir and never cusses or used inappropriate language. I am owed my money. The ball has been dropped multiple times by this company, with horrible customer service and issues. Michael himself told me that the recent new hires in this company have not been competent and there have been reports of many issues with the quality of service. A supervisor told me this. I expect a resolution this week. I work in finance and payroll and I don't think its money lions best interest to burn customers like me, when I have been compliant and communicative.",

Your membership payments are bi-weekly, so it just happens to be that in the month of August there are 3 payments because the first one is scheduled for August 1st.
