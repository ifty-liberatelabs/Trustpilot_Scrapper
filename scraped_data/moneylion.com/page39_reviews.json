        "text": "They claim your eligible for more than $100, however; you can only accept up to $100 at a time. I believe it's deceiving because all fees attached to EVERY advance we initiate become incorporated in whatever amount they claim we are eligible for. Each time and advance is taken, they asses the same amount of fees ($8.99) no matter if the advance is $1 or $100. Not to mention that in order to have instant access to any advance, it's an additional $3.99. Otherwise, the money will transfer to your bank account just as any banking transfer does, within 3-4 business days FEE FREE besides the $8.99.\nI could be wrong here but according to my experience and knowledge, the vast majority of instances where someone chooses to obtain an advance of any amount does so only because they NEED TO. Obviously, whatever circumstances they find themselves in- it's evident they need $ right away AND don't have any/enough. No one of sound mind and judgement would willfully choose to borrow money and pay 8.99 otherwise.  Clearly, the money they choose to borrow is needed right then, not 3-5 days later. Therefore, It's highly probable that they have to pay the constant amount of 8.99 PLUS an additional $3.99 for same day access to said advance (maybe more than once if more than $100 is needed.) They claim we can get an advance \"fee free,\" which only technically is PARTIALLY accurate because the only fee that theoretically doesn't have to be assessed is in the super rare case that a person can wait until whenever the normal bank transfer completes. EVERYONE IS ALWAYS PAYING $8.99 PER ADVANCE, PERIOD. Their BS claim of \"fee free\" is exactly that.\nNo ability to custom tip either. You choose their pre set tip amounts based on advance amount or you tip NOTHING. There's no other option.\n\nIMPORTANT! Please read: This app claims to provide you with up-to-date accurate personal credit information.  \nI DONT KNOW WHOSE CREDIT INFORMATION THEY HAVE AND CLAIM IT'S MINE, BUT EVERY MANUFACTURED BIT OF INFO IS NOT MINE, HAS NEVER BEEN MINE, WILL NEVER BE MINE.\nI've never owned any assets they claim I do. Every single figure they insist is associated with me is so STRAIGHT UP Impossible I can't believe it.\nUpon speaking with a representative, they had the audacity to insist that they obtained all the information from my bank. They insisted the information was up to date and accurate. Completely refusing to believe me when I explained that this is absolutely 100% NOT MY INFORMATION.\nCRAZY.\n\n Be certain they didn't go rogue with your credit information and that every single thing that they have documented is actually your own! \nMake sure that you go into the app and check your credit summary and make sure that they are using your information because I'm sure I'm not the only person with someone else's credit information.",
