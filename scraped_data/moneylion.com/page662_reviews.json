        "text": "My Roar money account was closed and support is almost non existent. There was mention of suspicious activity and now they are stating that I violated my deposit agreement. They returned an electronic transfer from a Hardship withdrawal from my companies retirement plan. The Deposit agreement states that there is no limits on deposits from a 3rd party. Even if there was it was only $7400 to help pay medical bills and a few other bills that I have accrued during the pandemic(my wife is deaf and recently had surgery as well as being unable to work because she relies on reading lips mostly). Customer service was atrocious, uncaring, and vague. I have been a customer for several years and bought in to their features such as shaking your phone for cash back rewards(.05 cents for $800) or the free cash advance that they will only let you take in $50 increments and charge $3.99 if you want the \"instacash\" instant then they repeatedly ask for tips and show you pictures of people pouting. Let's do the bath $3.99 plus $2-5 tip on 50 bucks=$5.99 to 8.99. I was also told that I would not be refunded any of my money that is currently in my account which thankfully is only $8.40 but honestly it would be nice to eat this weekend even if it's Ramen noodles. I have been treated better by cash advance places. Seriously if you can take your money to any other bank do it.",

Now when I REALLY need and depend on my instacash advance they LOCK me out after I've paid back my prior advance. Now all of a sudden saying \"IT cannot detect that I get direct deposit?\" CRAZY! How is this when I've had same employer and direct deposit going in for the past 3 years and nothing has changed😡 So freaking pissed! I had utilities scheduled to come out my account today and now all they left me with is $8 in my account. No Heads up that Instacash wasn't going to be available so I could have made other arrangements. NO NOTHING! THEY'RE TELLING ME THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.??? How Not???? This is a WHOLE BANK AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHATS GOING ON WITH THEIR PRODUCT??? AND DON'T EVEN GIVE THE CONSUMER A HEADS UP???? THIS IS NOT GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICE AT ALL...VERY DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER..NOT TRUST WORTHY FOLKS HERE..I WILL BE CLOSING MY ACCOUNT WITH THEM ASAP! SECOND TIME THEY'VE DONE THIS SINCE SWITCHING TO ROARMONEY MONEY..GARBAGE!!!!🤮👎👎👎👎👎",
