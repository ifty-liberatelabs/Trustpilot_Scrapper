I’m more cognizant of my spending and where to cut back on.  0% pay day loans up to 10% of my paycheck helps me during the half of the month when my bills are the most.  The 5.99% interest loan will help build my credit.  I get rewards for using the app $1 per day (into an investment account) and for using my debit card.  So now I’m investing daily and checking my spending daily.  I like that I get notifications for how much I’m spending and on what.  For example, $500 a month at Costco or $80 eating out last week.  I higher recommend MoneyLion.",

I immediately called CS and was told the payment would be moved to the 3rd and I could contact support to make the change permanent. Well the day was never moved, I've incurred 3 overdrafts from my primary bank and cannot get anyone from CS to speak, chat, or even email with.

Thank you!",
