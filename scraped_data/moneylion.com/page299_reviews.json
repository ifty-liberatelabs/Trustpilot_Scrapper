I can't add an account external if it's not mine and I would like to add my brother's account to my Money Lion App, also that when I have added my card to do instant transfers you guys actually suspended my transactions and I don't know why. But other from that MoneyLion is a great thing to use because it's accurate but you need to try and updated the statues so that people can start adding accounts externally even if it's not their name on the account because basically that's why I can add another account to my MoneyLion external, but thank you and I hope this helps update stuff",

            "message": "Hi Amber,\nThanks so much for your feedback! We’re really glad that you've enjoyed Instacash. We’ve found it’s definitely a customer favorite. The amount of Instacash you are eligible to receive is based on a variety of factors, including your MoneyLion account history, deposit and spending activity, repayment history, and other risk\\-based factors, as determined by MoneyLion in its sole discretion, and may change from time to time. Therefore, demonstrating consistent direct deposits and on\\-time payments can increase your Instacash eligibility, while a negative change in these factors could lower your Instacash eligibility. We're going to be reaching out to the email on file to help resolve your concerns. Thanks again for leaving a review and thanks for being the best part of MoneyLion!",
