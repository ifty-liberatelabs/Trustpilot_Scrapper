            "message": "We created Instacash to help you access extra money to cover everyday essentials and unexpected expenses, and we designed it easy to repay. For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash advances in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in an advance of $50 at a time. \n\nTipping is optional, and whether you choose to tip doesn’t affect your eligibility in any way. Pay what you think is fair, or don't pay at all, it's up to you. Just be sure to read the screens and make your selections carefully, and you can use Instacash without tips or fees if you choose. That said, if you choose to leave a tip — thank you! It helps us cover the costs of providing 0% APR cash Instacash advances to many, many folks like you!\n\nInstacash funding is FREE if you choose standard delivery, which takes only 24-48 hours. If you need your Instacash extra fast, you can choose instant Turbo funding for $4.99 (or $3.99 if you have our RoarMoney bank account). The Turbo fee is totally optional and just helps us cover the cost of delivering your cash advance instantly when you’re in a pinch. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly.",

        "text": "Very easy and helpful banking and fast cash \"instacash\" for those times of need and short on funding  only down side I'd honestly say is when you do the instacash their is a \"tip\" area for getting the funds you want or need. They start with an automatic $5 and goes as low as $2 but goes higher than $5. If you choose the no tip option they send quick message on screen kinda makes you feel bad but they have a $3.99 service charge to get it instantly even tho it's called instacash that means to me you get it right then not pay $3.99 so you can get it right now and also have to leave a tip.  They say it's not free and they are right they get $3.99 when you get it right then and then  tip. I don't want to sound un-greatful but if your getting that money the your probably already in need and having some issues financially so every dollar kept is better for individual.  I appreciate this app and money lion more than you'd guess by this review but it said be honest so that's exactly what I am doing. I have chosen no tip before and I already fee extremely horrible for asking for help and then reading that message just made me feel even worse but then I was able to get the house hold Items needed for our kids and family so I just sucked it up bitter cup.  One day hopefully I'll be able to get ahead enuf that I'm squared away and won't need to do instacash and will be able to purchase more crypto instead also brings to next awesome point you can do investing with the app as platform for another app/platform and moneylion is just facilitating the safe space to allow you to invest as you wish  amazing features I have my S.O. hooked up now finally and am waiting for rest of my peoples to set up and get hooked up. The more they do the more insensitive they provide for me as well  AIRBORNE ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU MONEYLION 💰 🤑 💸 💲 🪙 💶 💰 🤑 💸 💲 🪙 💶 FEELS GOOD TO HAVE THIS SUPPORT ESPECIALLY DURING THESE TRYING TIMES WE LIVE IN AND LACK OF ABILITY TO HAVE EVERYONE AROUND LIKE PRE-COVID DAYS AND HELP IS JUST A CLICK AWAY  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND SERVICES TO US ALL WHO ARE BENEFITING FROM THE AVABILITY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES available to us in time of need. Awesomeness 👌 👌 👌 👏 👍💯🤙👌🤙💯👊💯🫀💪",

We’re very grateful for customers like you and hope you stick with us for years to come! We would also like to state there is no shame if you cannot tip every time! Tipping is optional, and whether you choose to tip doesn’t affect your eligibility in any way. Pay what you think is fair, or don't pay at all, it's up to you. Just be sure to read the screens and make your selections carefully, and you can use Instacash without tips or delivery fees if you choose. That said, if you choose to leave a tip — thank you!
