        "text": "I have had nothing but problems with your meta bank. The Social Security Administration informed me that that is there number one problem with fraud and missing money, it through that bank. They advised me to change banks immediately as they the supervisor michael stated that if there is any fraud coming from that institution that they will not replace any direct deposits period. Then when I contacted both moneylion and MetaBank directly, and asked to speak with supervisors about my authorization hold of 646.19? Purchase from Amazon where they authorized the payment, yet the order was cancelled and they sent me an official email regarding this, they did not ship the item, did not take the money, I never received the product, refund and was never issued a credit for the missing money from Amazon for 646.19? Approximate amount... So I have called every single day both amazon and moneylion and have heard and gotten every reason and or excuse in the book. It's been almost 14 days now and I am beyond pist. So, having said that, I intend on contacting the FTC( federal trade commission),  The Dept. Of consumer. Affairs, the BBB, the news, and I will post and tweat and Facebook this horrible experience all over the internet that MetaBank rips customers off and that the SSA states that they have an issue with fraud and that their customer service department sucks. I even left them a message in great detail mind you and they still never had the common decency nor common consideration or respect to call me back or even do a follow up. So I am about ready to terminate my relationship with you unless I get my full refund from Amazon, that you reinstate my instacash to 250.00 because IDK qualify for it and you took it away from me right after I paid the last one off, and then you offerered me some loan that I accepted but have no access too and don't know hot to access it,  additionally, I keep having issues with my card not being able to use or transfer money into or out on the debit side using external accounts, and I want that old moneylion checking account that you no longer use off of my current profile please, because I want my c\nBa loan to be deposited into my new roar account. Please call me at 916- 586-4565 to address these issues and concerns.    Sincerely, MG",
