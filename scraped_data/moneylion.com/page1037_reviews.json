If I have $200 that needs to be repaid then do one transaction of 200 plus tips and fee, not 4",

For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time.
