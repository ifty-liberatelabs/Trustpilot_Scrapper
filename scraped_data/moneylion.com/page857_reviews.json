        "text": "I like MoneyLion. Particularly with the instacash upgrade, my borrow limit keeps increasing. I hope there could be an increase for the limit up to $1,000 perhaps to customers in good standing with the app. What I dislike is how long the wait time is for Customer Service, once it took a little more than 1 hour by the time a representative answered I fell asleep. Another things I don’t like is how they ask for my full social security number usually they just ask for the last 4 digits, that’s why I was worried in the beginning but fortunately I’v had no problems with MoneyLion. Also the membership is expensive, The price is $20 a month per member that’s approximately $240 a year and it charges a fee of $9.99 every two weeks which is $259 and in total a year that would sum up to $499 yearly. Besides all that I say give the app a go, definitely 4 stars rating.",
