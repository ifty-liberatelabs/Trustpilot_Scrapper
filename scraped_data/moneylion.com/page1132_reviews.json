I had 150 dollars available as well as one of my friends. we both got the 150, then it was paid like usual. well the day we paid it, I withdrew it again in 50 dollar increments. the first one I used the turbo so it would go directly on my card for the fee of 3.99. afterwards I did the free transfer. so then I checked and it said I had an overdue payment of 53.99, mind you I just paid off the 150 and redone it and it ends up being due the same day I got it. well they withdrew it back, and now says I have 0 dollars out of 25 dollars available, same with my friend. What the heck is going on. We have both always been on time with our payments, but this is not the first time I have had a problem with the instacash. They are trying to take money from you without you realizing it, and then when you catch it, you cant get a hold of them. Something has to be done because they are ripping people off. why should we be paying a membership fee if they are just messing everything up and we are unable to contact them, cant even contact them online anymore, they removed the general customer support form. They are quick to take your money, but when you have a problem, they are slow about fixing it, and another thing, you cant even withdraw from investment, which is rightfully ours. If this continues, legal action will be taken because they should not keep getting away with this. There should be no issues, we pay them monthly for their services and products so we should not be having any issues.",

I waited patiently then tried to apply for another loan it denied me. So I called customer service and was told that my account has to be open for the past 60 days which it was with a positive balance which it was. Everyday I call someone tells me something different. Your company needs to be shut down what’s the point of customer service when your service sucks.",

        "text": "HELP!! MoneyLion is ruining my credit and my life! My boyfriend and I both signed up for MoneyLion checking and plus loans in August 2019. First of all, I had no idea that there was a monthly service charge for using Loan Builder until I got a $9.99 charge on my account. NOW after looking again, they updated the payment to $29.99/mo? I didn’t agree to either! When we signed up, we added our debit cards for the sole reason that we were able to IMMEDIATELY deposit money via debit to make the loan payments. After a month, I logged on and there was no longer immediate deposit. Just gone, vanished. Thought that was weird. Then, got charged $41 FOUR times in one day via ACH and I DID NOT AUTHORIZE them to touch my checking account. It wasn’t even near my payment dates. They have tried to charge my account multiple times so I had to put a stop pay on my account because they were charging me random amount often. I now have not made a payment in 2 months because they won’t allow me to change my debit card information to a prepaid card because I’m afraid of fraudulent charges. They have reported late payments FOUR times in 2 months, dropping my credit score 180 points. I was already trying to build my credit and started at 600 now at 420 :( The same this is happening to my boyfriend and we were only trying to move forward into bigger and better things. Also, you don’t get that money right away so they are falsely saying that we aren’t making $86 payments which is NOT true. We were only supposed to be paying $41 for his and $27 for mine. I don’t know what to do but this is literally ruining us. I need to get legal. Someone please help!!!",

        "text": "Update: After posting my initial review, MoneyLion contacted me and immediately reimbursed my money and gave me 200 points towards rewards.\n\nOnly giving 1 star because I couldnt give them less. On 11/15, I called to pay the balance of my loan, $82.65. The rep for MoneyLion ran my card 4 times, charging me an additional $247.95. While on the phone with that person I received notice of these charges from my bank and ask about them. Eric from MoneyLion told me, \"well, I just wouldnt worry about it, I'm sure it didnt process.\" I immediately emailed filing a dispute and sent documentation from my bank along with it. I called back on the 18th, 22nd, 27th, Dec. 2nd and now Dec. 3rd. Today they said that my dispute had been closed, however I was never refunded my $247.95. When I asked why it had been closed, the representative I was speaking to had no clue as to why. Then wants to do a 3-way call with my bank at 6:22 p.m. in the evening. Now I am being told to file another dispute.",
