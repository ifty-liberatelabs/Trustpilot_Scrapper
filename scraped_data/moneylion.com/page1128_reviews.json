They are a SCAM of a company. \n\nI had a loan, paid it off from my investment account... well due to a glitch in their system it apparently never got paid off. So instead of calling or emailing me to let me know this, they reported me to the credit bureau as 60 days late! As soon as I saw I reached out. They said they needed to escalate the issue to ensure it was a glitch and they would contact me back.\n\nA week later... no one had contacted me. So I called again, same response and they asked me to fill out a dispute form. So I did all of that. \n\nA week later... still no update. So I went ahead and filed a claim with the BBB... a week later a girl named Jessica contacted me from MoneyLion. I called her back just a few minutes after her voicemail, and emailed her. No response... I tried again the next day. Same thing. Tried again... and FINALLY got ahold of her, she had no excuse as to why she was not responding.\n\nShe explained the issue and in order to just get it done I paid the amount, and asked for everything to be emailed. She agreed. Do you think I ever got an email? NOPE. I emailed her asking about it... no response. \n\nI finally got an email from the BBB with all of the information including the resolution which was to take up to 30 days to fix the credit reporting. Well it has been almost 30 days now, and initially they reported the paid in full but did not fix the late items. And NOW they just changed it again and it says 901-119 days late!!!! They have dropped my scored another 30 points!\n\nI have been on hold 33 minutes now to speak to a supervisor... and the girl before told me... oh well we can have you fill out the dispute form and wait. ARE YOU KIDDING ME! They are messing with my life now! I was disqualified for a house because of their error on my credit!",

Their Instacash takes over a week to reflect on your account despite having cleared your checking account, their loans take weeks or months to pay off, there are various unscheduled debits for membership and loan repayments that occur randomly and without warning, their 'shake the coinbag' is the most artificial stupidity ever created and their suggestions for loans and other financial products don't lead anywhere and nothing that you can not research yourself. So glad I never opened a checking account with them; once bitten, twice shy. STEER WELL CLEAR. You have been warned!",

Their engineers or 2. Specialized team but it never gets resolved. My loan is still showing outstanding when I have already paid it off. You impacted my credit (while I’m in the process of getting a mortgage) by inaccurately reporting me late when I never missed a payment. I need the app updated not in 30 days, not next week, but now. I have called them to get it escalated countless times, only to be put on hold or hung up on.  I do already see a lawsuit was filed against your company in Virginia and another one in California for excessive fees. Please do not fall for the CreditBullder Plus loan like I did.",

        "text": "Worst customer service imaginable phone also. Overall you are a terrible bank that has representatives that do everything but actually accuse you of deception. You are so far away from any type of decent customer service it is unbelievable that you are still in business. But I will make sure and let all of my friends and co-workers what type of service you provide don't worry. Over 1000 people between social accounts is not a lot but those 1000 have friends and sometimes the right post just goes viral maybe not mine might be a friend's or maybe their friends entirely possible the way it's been lately I'm a small business you are large and pay trust pilot so your star ratings are fake. Why would anyone do business with you when majority of the reviews are 1 star yet your overall is a4? Now we know to have a paid account with trustpilot .\nAlso they have my money in limbo while they decide whether I'm a scammer or not. Meanwhile they know I'm sitting at a gas station and out of gas. Excellent customer service NOT!!!",

        "text": "This company is complete and utter lowlife scum trash. you guys refuse to answer the freaking phone you guys do not care about your customers whatsoever. I received a $500 loan at 5.99% interest. not only did you guys screw up my bank account information but I got multiple 30-day late notices on my account and you guys continue to not answer the fu#king phone!!! and then when I finally got ahold of you guys you guys corrected my bank account information after you guys admitted messing up on a recorded line. I paidy that loan off in full which led to me having a zero balance. it is now may of 2020 and I continue to get 30 to 60 to 90 to 120 day late notices on my credit bureaus you guys have created two or three different new accounts under my name!!! I do not have an account with moneylion anymore!! I filed a cbfd claim to the credit bureaus and money lions response was they made a mistake and they would reverse the late which they haven't and I continue to receive late notices and somehow now I have a $19 balance with them even though I have them on a recorded line stating back in October I have a zero balance and I do not have an account with them. I continue to try to call them sit on hold for 30 minutes and then I get a recording stating we're not available confirm your phone number and someone will call you back in 30 minutes to an hour and no one has ever done that, I've tried calling 15 times since October 2019 I get the same response no answer  BS recording this company is utter fu#cking trash!!!!!",
