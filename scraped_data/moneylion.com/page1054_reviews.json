        "text": "I have to give Moneylion five stars. I've been using them along with my traditional banks for over a year now and am very happy with there services. I haven't ran into any issues yet so that's a plus. \n\nMoneylion has so many features available and I personally use them for a checking account, investment account, weekly cash advances in between paydays and best of all I can improve my credit score with there mid-term loans. \n\nSo say you start out with a $500 loan, you get a certain percentage of the loan immediately and the remaining amount goes into a holding account. The reason they do this is to get a feel for your worthiness.  Every week you pay around $9 - 15 which will come out to roughly $50 a month which then gets reported to your credit bureaus. If you successfully pay off the loan you can then take out another loan except this time they will give you more money upfront. You can also pay off your life an early with no penalties. The best part is the interest on the loans are very small, I think it's 5%.\n\nAnother cool feature is, to get the features like weekly instacash advances and the mid-term loans, you have to pay a membership of $19.99 per month. \n\nBut if you open the app and slide through the daily info cards on a daily basis and use your Moneylion debit card multiple times per month, you get that membership fee or part of the membership fee refunded and put into your investment account at the beginning of every month. Now I learned first hand it's not easy because there will be days you forget to open the app or maybe you aren't using the debit card enough because to get the full fee amount back every month, I would have to login the app consecutively the whole month and have at least 20 or more $10+ purchases on my ML debit card.\n\nI usually end up getting $7 on average refunded a month. But for people that use ML as there primary checking account getting the full amount would be much easier.\n\nI could go on and on about all the cool features but I think I've bored you all enough. The last think I'll mention is there \"shake n bake\" rewards. Everytime you make a transaction with your ML debit card, once that transaction settles you have 48 hours to claim your shake n bake rewards. You click the button, shake your phone and you win a percentage of the transaction cost which is put into your investment account. So far the biggest amount I have won is $0.50 lol but it adds up. You get a penny hear, a nickel there, just think how many transactions you make a month and the reward you can get with each one. Pretty cool.",

So if I’m approved for $200 instacash, I end up paying back around $230. \n***the app makes lots of mistakes and has a lot of glitches. Like big deal glitches. One time I didn’t get my instacash but they took the repayment out of my acct. ***I can’t open a roar money acct because they say they can’t verify my identity. Something about my address being wrong. Um nope. I’ve lived here for 18 years. I know my address. And I typed it correctly. ***My bank becomes unlinked an awful lot. ***they charge you too much for the membership. I think fees end up being around $20 a month. That’s too much for an app that causes me stress. \n\nAnd the ugly:-  The customer service is the worst I have ever dealt with. Well second to worst. Moneylion customer service either never writes you back, OR writes you back without fully reading the question and send the wrong generic answer. And if you don’t read their answer email and reply right away they close your ticket. So you’re crap out of luck if they don’t fix the issue. THEN, they want you to take a survey on your experience but if you have concerns or complaints and click on the link at the end of the survey to submit it..... the link is broken!!!!!\nAnd when I finally got a Customer service manager to email me back regarding  my complaints, My concerns were treated so nonchalantly and I Pretty much got a ‘I feel your frustration, but it is what it is’ \n\nIf they got new app designers and didn’t have such a buggy app, and got new customer service reps or guidelines, AND did away with the ridiculous fees, it would be the best app out there if it’s kind.",
