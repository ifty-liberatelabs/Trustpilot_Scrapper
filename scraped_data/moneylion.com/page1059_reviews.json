Anyhow before now they were great checks arrived early and had 275$ worth of instacash to fall back on as a safety net but recently those of us that are still laid off like myself went from making only 300$ less than my weekly checks at my job to now making only 1/4 of what I would be in a week if I were back to work and now instacash doesn't see regular deposits so I lost 200 dollars I was depending on since we all knew the changes that were coming our way..\n What I didn't know is that instacash would immediately take my ability to get a loan after I'm already suffering bc UIA wasn't set up with it's replacement aide solution for those 0f us that are suffering bc not all companies are back full throttlw yet.  They also tried to tell me I received a refund that I hadn't and I told them I had the proof they refused to view it and proceeded to tell me I received thay which ai hadn't..\n So personally I woild not advise using money lion amymore they aren't the same company that used to care more about their clients",

See what they do is give you a $1000 loan, but only make a portion of that loan available to you, that way, once you’re done making your on time payments, you can have the rest of the cash it saved for you to spend however you’d like PLUS a credit score boost! WIN-WIN!!!",

The offer will show you how much of your loan funds you’ll get right away and how much will be saved in a Credit Reserve Account and then given to you when you’ve paid your loan in full. This is to help you save while you build credit! \n\nYour Credit Reserve Account is an interest-bearing account maintained by MoneyLion’s SEC-registered investment advisor. If you default on your loan, your Credit Reserve Account may be liquidated to partially or fully pay off what you owe.
