Sent a text as their contact page suggests and still nothing. My CU was helpful in that they are changing all of my account numbers, but silence from MoneyLion.\n\nUpdate: Got some quick attention once I filed a CFPB complaint. The funds were credited back to the Moneylion account, but I cannot access it as the account was flagged for fraud. Then I was told they sent the funds back to my debit card, which has been deactivated and changed to a new number, so still waiting on my funds.",

I had a $1,000 transaction that supposedly took place at Walmart on either June 8th or June 10th.\n\nTheir statements mention one date, but the Advocacy Department gave me another. Regardless, I didn't make that transaction. The card was supposed to have been closed, because an hour before that transaction was made, there was an attempt at a Bank of America ATM. The Bank of America ATM declined the card and shut it down, recognizing it as fraud.\n\nYet, Pathward/MoneyLion did not close the card as they were supposed to. They allowed the same transaction to be made at a Walmart 1 hour later and they keep denying the dispute. They refuse to comment on the fact that Bank of America sent a notification to shut the card down due to too many attempts using the wrong pin number. An hour or two later, the same transaction was made after my card was supposedly closed.\n\nThis was an unauthorized transaction and the Advocacy Department refuses to refund me. They also won't allow me to file disputes for packages that I purchased but did not receive. They filed these disputes as unauthorized transactions and refuse to allow me to dispute them, even though they are in the wrong. I did not receive these items.\n\nThey even sent a check worth $347 to the wrong address. Pathward/MoneyLion said it would take 4-8 weeks to investigate, despite acknowledging that they sent the check to the wrong address. They refuse to refund me for this check that I didn't receive. All in all, they owe me.\n\nI have provided information that should result in them crediting me. This includes the Bank of America decline, which shut down my card, but they reopened the card and allowed the same transaction that BoA had declined. These items they would not allow me to dispute were not received, even after I filed a police report. They owe me $2,200 in total.\n\n\n\nHere are the transactions: On 6/7, an item worth $63.11 was not received. On 6/7, another item worth $87.44 was not received. On 6/9, an item worth $43.60 was not received. On 6/8, an item worth $38.51 was not received.\n\nOn 6/6, a transaction worth $303 was unauthorized. Finally, on 6/9, an item worth $47.65 was not received.\nI just received a another letter from Shawn from your advocates and i posted on your CEO twitter page, he states my card was closed on June 9th, please tell me why the dispute that happened on June 10th keeps being denied when it was a 1000 transaction at a Walmart, also I am waiting on Moneylion to pay their part to the ADR for a arbitration",

        "text": "When it's good it's good, when it's bad it's absolutely horrifying. I have been a money lion customer for almost 2 years and had very little issues until this past week. I have had the same bank account for 15 years and the same moneylion account for 2 years. On 7/14, I requested $400 to help pay a mortgage payment because I started a new job and the transition from one job to another left me a bit short-handed. Having done this hundreds of times over the last two years, I opted for the 2 to 4 day direct deposit to save on fees. I have done this many times over the last 2 years and know that it typically takes two business days. I have never had it take longer than that and I had done $100 insta cash rapid transfer the day before with no issue. On 7/15 I received a text stating that my money lion account was frozen and I needed to submit ID for verification. Since I have been a customer of moneylion for so long, I pretty much knew this was fraud right away. Instead of responding I went straight to money lion, checked my account and transferred $20 via insta cash just to make sure everything was working well. It was so I took screenshots of the text and reported it as fraud. By Wednesday, the $400 insta-cash still had not gone into my account so I contacted chat support. They gave me the usual run around that it takes up to five business days (which it never had before but they have to say that because that's their policy) and was told I had to wait until the 19th before I could file a complaint. The 19th came around and of course the money did not go in my account. I called them and they informed me that I had to wait till the end of the business day on the 19th. The 19th is a Friday. I knew that no transactions were ever completed on the weekends. But I let them go through their spiel anyway, because what else could I do?Saturday July 20th I called again as I still had not received the cash, but it was no real surprise because it was the weekend. I told them I was not paying for cash I did not receive and wanted to cancel the transaction. They told me they could not cancel the transaction. But they would escalate it. They immediately tried to blame it on the it outage, but I had already done my research before calling and knew that they were not affected by that outage at all. Today is the 20th I still have no money from them and I still have to pay them back on Friday the 26th. I asked to move the payment to the next payday because I haven't received the money, but then they went into a big long explanation of how they could absolutely do that but that would freeze my money lion account so I could not borrow anymore. I asked them why that was because this was not my fault and the error was on their end so why was I being punished? The customer agent just repeated from the script she was reading so I left my payment due date as is. I just want to say that getting an actual person takes hours. Their customer service line is a joke and it just leads you around in automated circles until you figure out how to hit the right button to get an actual human. Customer service agents are not based in the US and very often the accent/language barrier can make things much more difficult than it needs to be. There have been multiple times during this past week where I have had to hang up and start all over because I simply couldn't understand the person on the other end. I don't say that to be rude, it was just a fact. So here it is Sunday July 21st, and the money I requested on July 14th has still not gone into my account and no one can tell me when or if it will. But I still have to pay $500 and some dollars back on the 26th even though I've only actuallyreceived $120. Asking for a supervisor gets you absolutely nowhere. I do have copies of all of the transcripts from my chat conversations, but what good is that if you have no supervisor to send it to? After 2 years of loyalty and happiness with their service I will probably not use them again because of this fiasco. Just wanted others to be aware. \nUpdate 7/22/24: another several hours spent between chat & phone calls today because the money still has not gone into my bank account. Chat resulted in them wanting me to prove I never received the money by a three-way phone call (which I am not capable of because I do not have a phone that does three-way) or a bank statement showing I never received the money. My question to them was why do I have to prove that I never received the money when you can clearly see in your computers that it was never sent? So I logged out of chat/saved the transcript & called the customer service line. Half an hour on the phone with customer service & they promised me they would escalate it, as they said before & did not. They moved my payment date out 2 weeks because I told them I wasn't paying back money that I didn't receive & then froze my account. Still no money. I will never use them again.",
