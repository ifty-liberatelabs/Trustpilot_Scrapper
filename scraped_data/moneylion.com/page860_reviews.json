Only thing id change is how much they try to get you to tip, they're almost tricking you by putting it on the bottom hoping you miss it. btw it's automatically set to 5 dollars and they do it again right before you submit your advance!\n\nAlso I'd change the advance amount per advance. The limit is only 50, why can't you set the limit higher so we do not have to do it multiple times?\n\nOverall great app as long as you follow the rules and pay back what you owe on time.",

        "text": "This is a great site the only issue i have is that there is no upfront information about after you get the Insta cash before you transfere it to an external bank account you need ti select the the turbo option on every sibgle $50 advance if you want to get the money immediately otherwise it's three to five business days for the deposit to finally post your external bank account don't make the mistake I did. Not to mention that instead of giving you the full $250 upfront you get them in $50 increments up to $250 so you have to push the turbo option every time in order for all of the deposits to be instantly put into your external bank account it would have been a lot easier if they had just let you get the advance in one lump sum instead of several increments very confusing. Been a little bit more orderly other than that this is a great website for helping people who are having a little bit of a struggle and need a payday advance they have a lot of other neat opportunities to help you financially to get more secure with your finances and rebuild your credit it's pretty good website it just needs to kind of maybe fix some of those things\nOtherwise check it out it's a great place to go secure very reliable and trustworthy",
