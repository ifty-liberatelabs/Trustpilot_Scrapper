I got an email telling me that my phone number was changed in my account and it was associated with another Moneylion account. So I immediately locked my cards and called customer service. I was unaware that a 397.00 transaction was done to Target and a transfer of 200.00 was made from my external account. The lady on phone gave me the fraud team which was going to help me. Not so much. After my dispute was made, I changed my password and felt safe. But after 3 days tjey told me that there was no error and I would not get my money back. I went to work. Found the the Target from which the purchase was made and talked to their security. This target was located in NH and I live in Louisiana. This was an online purchase and they also agreed after checking my online Target account that this was not my purchase. I also had the email from Moneylion telling me someone had got into my account with a 303 area code which in Delaware. I called them at Moneylion. They listened I sent them all the info and they decided me that the would give me a provisional credit. Well they have now came back saying they still found no error. I‚Äôm just speechless. 397.00 of my money that I did not use and I‚Äôm being penalized because someone breached my account and though my cards got locked they let this happen. I‚Äôm so disappointed and furious. I will again have to go thru the trouble to get back money I did not spend. So so much for their support. I do like so many parts of this company until you run into a problem.",

        "text": "The instacashes were great, problem is the credit builder plus loan, they offer you a minimum loan but don't give you the entire loan and will only give you $200 out of the $1000, and have you keep making payments on that $1000 loan eventhough you didn't get the entire amount. Then they refuse to close your account app request until you pay the full $1000, then they mess up your credit score by stating you owe $1000, when you were only given $200. This company is a joke and a scam it should be reported to BBB, how dare you guys force people to pay amounts that was promised but was never given?",

        "text": "I've been a member for several years. They will change requirements to use their features without telling you. They will also send you emails saying we gave you an instacash boost then there won't be anything available and support says \"you have already used the boost a week earlier\". So basically the \"thank you for being a loyal customer here is a 75 dollar instacash boost\" is misleading. Also I've gotten several credit builder loans. The last one I paid off way earlier with the thinking of just getting another one. So I paid 330 remaining on a 500 loan, the app says you are approved for 500 but when you get to the part to accept and sign off it gives an error \"it's not you it's the internet\" then you contact support and they tell you it is you and you need to have a second checking account added in good standing. Ok so they push using them for direct deposit and your banking but expect you to get a secondary account to access services for which you are paying. Had I known this I would have kept paying the minimum. Instead I over extended myself and paid it off which has now caused me to fall behind on bills. If this was communicated clearly then i could have made a better decision. The requirements are just disclosed to their support.Then instacash they only let you withdraw it in 100 dollar increments so let's say you have an 800 limit each 100 you request they tack on fees then they ask you for a tip. Then if you don't give a tip the next time you use it they have some picture of a condescending looking guy talking about how money doesn't grow on trees... But if you are paying back every two weeks just the fees alone would be a high apr if this was a traditional loan. There have been many other situations that I have had to deal with over the years that I would not have to deal with if I was with a traditional bank.",
