The repayment is the next day, Friday.  I was charged $7.99 for the instant cash and for transferring the money.  So, I was charged $57.99 for having the money for 24 hours. Why not just immediately send the money to my bank account instead of freaking Roar Money which you never really take the time to explain what it is or how it's supposed to be used.  When I contacted the customer service department the person I spoke to just kept quoting me company policy (which is TRAINED behavior) and didn't help me at all.",
