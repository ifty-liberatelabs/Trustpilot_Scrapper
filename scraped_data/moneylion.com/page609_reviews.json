For these reasons, we allow you to take out Instacash advances in increments of $50 or less. Of course, if you’ve unlocked an Instacash limit higher than $50, it will all still be available to you if you need it. You’ll just have to take it out in advances of $50 at a time. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly.",

The only thing I would suggest changing, with regards to InstaCash, would be to have the ability to select a different repayment date; or the ability to extend it a week. It’s great that it predicts future deposit dates, however there may be months that it gets moved to the right by a few days. Prompting a response for the repayment date selected would only ensure that it’s repaid in a timely manner.",
