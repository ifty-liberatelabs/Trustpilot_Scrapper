They processed the normal from my debit card and then today I wake up and they took out the same amount again but this time from my checking account. I received a very strange email from them stating \"Since we have not received your Instacash payment of $***.** that was scheduled for repayment on Jul 15, 2022, we have initiated a withdrawal of this amount from your authorized and linked bank account.\" It is July FIRST!! So they took out the payment that wasn't due for another 15 days. They refuse to put the money back in my account today and told me it could take 5 days or so before they can see the payment come through on there end. To top things off the scheduled payment for 7/15/22 is still showing as scheduled so they are going to take it out again!",

I had planned to tip more remaining within my card balance and was distraught when my card declined. Fortunately I had cash. Embarrassing and lesson learned. \nThis however is a helpful tool when you run short on cash and need a quick boost in funds. Money is available instantly and at a reasonable fee,I still wish the cash amounts were adjustable not in set increments. I have had to reach out to customer service and they are nice real people that address your concerns quickly and completely.\nOverall I recommend Money Lion 100%",
