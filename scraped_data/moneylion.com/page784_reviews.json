Secondly, MoneyLion is a loan service. They have a variety of options, depending on credit. If you qualify for Instacash, it’s like a payday service - except they only charge the fee (as low as free if you’re willing to wait + optional tip) on payback. If you get other loans, they are reported to the credit agencies and will boost your credit - as long as you pay on time.\nOverall, I’d recommend checking out their services (signing up is free) and seeing if it’s right for you.",
