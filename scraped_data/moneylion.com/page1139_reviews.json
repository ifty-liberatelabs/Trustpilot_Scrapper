The phone number supplied says open today on Saturday abut when you call it says the office is closed.  I withdrew half of my investment account on 8/9/19 and still have yet to see the money.  I think it is time to complain to the better business bureau.  I fear the worst.\n\nUpdate:  I got a message from the company to call on a special number which I did and same old \"the office is closed message\".  Said agents were online - WHERE?  there is no way on the app to get a link to a live agent or to even place a support request.  nothing works.\n\n2nd update:  I quickly received responses, even personal phone call and messages from top executives -- they are committed to fixing my issues and recognize that improvements are needed.  Very impressed with Trustpilot as well - it worked!",

        "text": "Horrible services I ever encountered in my life.  I had signed up for money lion a week ago and was approved for 175. I downloaded their online app so I can transfer the money I was approved for into my bank account. The process was unsuccessful trying to transfer the funds into my bank account so I had called them letting them know the issue and we tried another solution was to wait for a money lion card to come into the mail which will take 3-5 business days. I patiently waited and no card came. I had then decided to call and cancel everything because of whats the sense of taking a loan a week ago and can't even use or get access to the money I was approved for? I called money lion this past Monday to cancel my request and delete my in information which they did but I also made it clear the representative I was speaking with I hope they were not going to be an issue taking any money out my account since I was approved for the loan but never did once used the money. The representative informed me since I never had the chance to use the loan I was approved for that nothing will come out of my account because I had to make sure it was some clarity before I proceeded to cancel this money lion account. Today I had woke up with an overdraft of money lion for 175 the money I was approved for and never ever used the money. like how this is ridiculous shame on you money lion for doing something like this. I called my bank which they told me they will put a stop payment so money lion will never have access to take anything out my account again and they will cover my overdraft fees. My bank helped me out than money lion since I called you guys not too long ago and the representative had the audacity and told me they had the right to take the money out my account since I choose to cancel? First of all that does not make any sense as I was approved for the money and did not use the money at all? You guys are liars and scams I will report you guys on BBB complaint and my bank is already proceeding with an investigation on fraud charges and the money lion will not take anything out my account ever again.",
