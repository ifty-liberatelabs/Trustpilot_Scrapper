        "text": "I was a little hesitant on signing up for Moneylion plus but my sister recommended it because she got approved for the $500 loan and got it instantly. When I signed up I was told to wait 30 days (which is totally fine and was expected). I'm guessing if you get denied they make you wait to build trust. Cool. Its been 30 days and I love how I was able to get the loan instantly no problems. I was confused on not being able to take out any investments whenever I wanted and that my payments were posting a week late every week. I gave it 4 stars because of how hard it is to reach customer service! I tried chatting with an agent 4 times and the first 3 times they take almost an hour to get back to you and close the chat right away if you do not reply. If I'm waiting one hour to chat, they can wait at least 10 minutes. My phone wouldn't get a notification when they reply. Anyways, I see a lot of bad reviews but I haven't had any real issues- the agent told me the investment account has to maintain a minimum of $150 and anything above that can be withdrawed. If you have a loan however- anything above the 150 + the loan amount (in my case $650) can be taken out. Again- totally fine because this company does give the benefit of the doubt. I didn't want to take money out but it was out of curiosity- and they said once you cancel the membership that full amount gets returned. I've been using Moneylion over a month and I'm praying there is no fraud involved. So far so good. Love the low interest rate for the loan and the speed! I'll post another review after I've reached $150 and paid my loan off!",

Not only have I paid my loan and all my account fees but I’ve also been logging in daily to receive the $1 a day. They say once you get $150 in your account you can then transfer funds or even withdraw them. I’ve had over $150 in my investment account since 45 days ago. And now the app says I don’t have enough money to transfer to my moneylion checking account from my investment account. There’s $178 in my investment account. So I called them today and I got attacked by one of there workers saying there’s nothing they can do for me and that they don’t know what’s wrong??????????? I’m really confused and now I’m late on my rent this month due to them lying about there own rules and regulations.... do not use this app or there services they will steal and keep your money. Pl are stay away from money lion. Oh and last month they said I only paid $2 for my loan and I made all of my payments. These guys will scam you and steal your money stay away from moneylion please stay away. \n\n\n\n STAY AWAY FROM MONEY LION!!!!! THEY WILL KEEP YOUR MONEY AND NOT LET YOU HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR FUNDS.

They say that no liquidation request was made (I made sure when talking to the guy originally that it would be liquidated and in my account in 7-10 business days). So I asked to speak to a supervisor who said he personally submitted the liquidation request and I would receive my money in 7-10 business days. I call them 7 business days later to check on the status and they tell me that the liquidation is in process and the money should be in my account in 3-5 business days. So I wait 5 business days and call today. The guy said that the liquidation is still in process and doesn’t know what is going on but he will send a message to the higher ups to see what is going on. It has now been a month since I originally canceled my account and still haven’t gotten my money. They’re just giving me the run-around like the other reviews I have read stated.

I closed my external account because I thought MoneyLion was a good deal but as other reviews have stated, “if it sounds to good to be true...” (you know the rest). \n\nAs of today I have called three different days and emailed once (with no reply whatsoever). The biggest problem is that since I am now behind on my payments (due to their negligence) and I am missing out on the $1 per day cashback. This essentially takes a “no fee” checking account to one that’s charging a hefty penance. \n\nIn addition, the time it takes for items to post is ridiculous and the external transfers take way too long. It’s 2018, ACH transfers should be completed the next business day. \n\nSave your time and pass on this one. The idea is great but the company has no idea how to actually execute it!",

        "text": "I have to say from the start that this is an initial rating from me regarding my brief experience with trying to get setup with MoneyLion. The first issue I had was trying to get my bank account setup. The system kept insisting I was inputting the wrong routing number and I verified it with my bank more than once, so I switched to another one of my bank accounts. After that I made it to the part of the setup where it asks you to input a promo code in which the letter I received in the mail states that you get $10 bonus if you join before 12/5/2018. However, there is no promo code and when I called customer service the rep had no clue about the $10 bonus having a code if it wasn't on the letter. I could tell by her tone she was content with letting me go without trying to find out about it. She put me on hold and never came back to the phone. Another thing is that I can't say this is false advertising because it never states this anywhere in the brochure I received in the mail, but I was under the impression that when you signed up and pay the $29 membership you get to apply and get the $500 loan right away. I'm not a fan of the \"Oh by the way clauses\" that you're subject to run into with loan offers. But towards the end of the sign up it said that you have to prove your commitment for 30 days before getting access to the $500 loan. I hope someone replies to this posting and explain that and why it isn't stated on the brochure. So easy to think that the loan is immediate when it's not. Not everyone wants to wait 30 days for a $500 loan especially when there is a membership fee.",
