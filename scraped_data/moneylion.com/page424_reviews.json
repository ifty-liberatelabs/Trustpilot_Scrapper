        "text": "Tried to close my account in Sept 2021, and just as before, their customer service is lukewarm garbage, practically non-existent. It took me forever to get a rep on the phone, through a maze of IVR menus and long pre-recorded messages, which I finally navigated to speak to a human. \n\nThe rep is clearly reading from scripts, and has left me sitting on hold for at least 20 minutes (while we only interacted for about 2 minutes). He never even bothered to ask me why I'm closing my account. I requested full deletion from their database (per my legal rights as a US consumer); the rep cannot tell me exactly what personal information they'll be holding onto, after my deletion request. He referred me to their site's Terms and Conditions, which also do not state exactly what pieces of my personal information they'll be holding onto. So now I'm hold for a supervisor; the rep tried to get me to \"wait for a call back from a supervisor within 24 hours\" but I said no, I'll hold, because I know better than to think I can count on this company to follow up. It's been 10 minutes on hold waiting for an available supervisor, to tell me exactly what personal information of mine they'll be keeping - because that is not listed in the website's terms and conditions. \n\nWe're in the age of identity breaches folks, and this \"bank\" that's now publicly traded, and farms out their support calls overseas, can't even tell you exactly what of your personal information they'll be keeping after you *try* to close your account (SS#? DOB? The ingredients for *another* identity breach, through a bank that's impossible to get ahold of on the phone?). Their website won't even let you change your address, or phone number. \n\nStay far, far, far, away. Find a local credit union, or set fire to your hard-earned cash, because that's better than being bitten by MoneyLion. MoneyLion is not a bank; they should never have been given a license to do banking business in the US. It's a scam, to steal your money, waste your time, and pad the pockets of stockholders, thanks to their recent IPO. I feel sorry for anyone who has ever given them a dime of their money, or a minute of their time.\n\n\n\nSept 2021 Update: After 65 minutes on the phone with the first rep, a supervisor finally called me from another line. She said they will be reviewing their IVR menu, and their policies for when a customer calls to cancel their account. I still say, stay far away from this publicly traded bank, because they're clearly not spending that IPO money on more call center staffing. Otherwise it wouldn't have taken me almost 75 minutes to get an answer that any local bank teller could have given me in 75 seconds.\n\nOriginal review on Play store, from fall 2019: Tried FOR MONTHS to verify my account to get their loan. I've lived in the same state my whole 47 years of life, & the same county for 23 years. They take a business week to turn around email requests. If you manage to get someone on the phone, they read off scripts and give you stock, unhelpful answers. Loan terms are ridiculous: 1) pay $20/mo for Plus; 2) Get a $500 loan - oh wait, now that you've got the loan, btw you only get $125 now, then pay us $900 over 2 years, then you get your other $375. So I paid off the $500 ASAP, and they waited 2 weeks to release the $375.",
