        "text": "The checks are fine, they’re just... checks. But the problem is the misleading pricing. What started as an order for their basic checks (125 for $8.99), turned into a $24.88 after all the extra charges and tax. $3.60 for handling(what’s that?!), $10.45 for basic shipping with tracking on a very small envelope, which was in fact handed off to USPS from DHL and ended up with no tracking info until I requested it from the company. Which also begs the question, why would you ever ship checks with no tracking?\nThis is 2021, be up front about pricing. If those are your costs, figure it in up front instead of the extremely misleading base price. I wouldn’t have balked at paying $20 or more for the checks, instead of realizing the price was too good to be true after I got half way through the order process.",
