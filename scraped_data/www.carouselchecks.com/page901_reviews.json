But they are still cheaper than most sites that offer check ordering services.\n\nUpdate:  I was contacted by Carousel Checks and they refunded my handling charge.  Very nice customer service approach.  I have changed their rating from 3 stars to 4 stars due to this.  Perhaps they should change their sales approach and include a handling fee and box charge up front in their 'base cost' so there's no problem.  The checks themselves are great.",
