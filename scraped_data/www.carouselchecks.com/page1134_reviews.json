Like a goober I switched my billing and shipping addresses, so I  needed to change it. The woman I spoke with couldn't find it so she took down my number and said she would fix it for me as soon as it appeared in her system. She called me later that day, like she said she would.

Upon reviewing the checks I noticed an error in our zip code, even though the billing statement was correct and so was the address label on the shipping bag. When I called customer service they wanted to charge me to reprint the checks. I asked how this error occurred when I simply copy and pasted my billing address information- which as I stated before - the billing label and shipping label was correct. The rep couldn't answer how that happened. I stated , at very least, there should be a cross check between the checks information to the billing and shipping label:and..... If they don't match a call should be made to the customer. The rep insisted they could fix the error and reprint the checks but at my cost. This is a very basic company without the basic security you would want a check company to have. Save your money and buy from a reputable company.",
