I find the price to be pretty good for personalized checks.  I receive many complements and highly recommend your company.  I received my checks in less than two weeks too, another plus.\n\nI highly recommend Connie for recognition of her outstanding work.  She was so very helpful and so pleasant.  She was on top of the ordering process from when I ordered checks from her last year.  She remembered me and even remembered the pictures I had put on my checks.  Connie is such a great 'asset' to your company.  I will always want to deal with Connie, she's amazing!  I do hope this gets to the right person to let Connie know how great and amazing she is.\n\nThank you,\nNancy Miller",

I placed both the order same time dame day together. \nWhen I received both the orders same time I noticed that address on checks were printed wrong. I called customer service. The lady knew that address on checks was printed incorrect. She told me that it was my mistake that I did not proofread it right and she was right . I should have proofread it. So I accepted my mistake. She told me that she will print the checks right but I have to pay $6.00 shipping. I agreed with that too. She told me that she will be nice enough to make sure she send replanted check by express mail.\nShe charged me over $7.00 instead of $6.00 and still after many days I do not have my checks. I received my first order faster than this express represented order. This is totally uneasiness like and dishonest .\nI will be very happy if they refund $7.41 shipping charge.\nPost date\n05/30/2019\n\nDescription\nCarousel Checks 708-613-2452 \n\nAmount\n$7.41 Charge",
