They also advertised being a certain amount less than checks ordered through the bank.  I did some comparison checking with other online check companies and was satisfied with the amount that I thought I was going to pay.  However, once I got through the process of entering all my check information and reviewing it for accuracy, I got to the final check-out page where a “handling fee” of I believe over $14 was added on to the total cost of my order.  I was so disappointed that the money I thought I was saving was added back onto the cost in another way.  By this point I was too far in with my order and was ready to place it.  I didn’t want to start over with a new search for checks.  I also looked on the company’s website for a description about this fee or that it was perhaps explained in the FAQs.  I could have missed it but did not see it stated anywhere on the site.  So while I am happy with the quality of the checks, I do not think I will be ordering again from Carousel Checks due to this added cost.",
