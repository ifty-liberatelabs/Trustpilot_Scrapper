This tracking # was also delayed .. but eventually shipped via fedex then changed hands to USPS. CS response was to refund me the intial shipping instead of just shipping the checks expedited so i could receive them in the time frame which was expected. Overall this whole process took 11 business days and a total of 17 (1 day being a holiday) total days including weekends. \n\nIF i was relying on receiving the checks in a timely manner to pay bills with -- this would of created a huge issue for me. \n\nanyway, quality of checks are great, but this company needs a major SOP review.",
