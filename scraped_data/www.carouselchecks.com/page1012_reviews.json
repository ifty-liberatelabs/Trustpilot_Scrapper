However, I live in a rural area and FEDEX was very slow to deliver the package - one week longer than stated. \n    The Blue squared design looks very colorful on the website, but in reality the shades of blue are quite muted.  I like the design itself; it's unusual and quite modern.",

I only received 2 and they don't come with any invoice, packing slip or otherwise. So, was not happy with that at all but really had no way on contacting them, Just be aware of what you are ordering I guess. I feel I had no recourse on this last order....",
