I searched and thought I had found the exact same checks but when I received them they were a cheaper version of my checks and not at all what I wanted.  I've since learned that the original checks I ordered through my bank were from the institutional division and \"Carousel\" is the cheaper branch. Yes, you do pay more from the institutional branch. But given Carousel's hidden fees, lack of check boxes and cheap looking product as other reviewers have mentioned, I would gladly have paid a little more. The online purchasing process seemed to be designed to get one to buy much more. Several boxes of all different varieties of checks mysteriously appeared in my basket at check out. Carousel Checks has printed their web address on the front of my personal checks and that's just tacky self promotion. I give Carousel two stars because the checks arrived quickly and printing was satisfactory.",

I ordered the brushed metal design and they look like I printed them at home on my home computer. Literally the cheapest looking checks I've ever had. I had to pay for expedited shipping since I needed checks to use right away and didn't realize I had used my last check until I needed to write another. So, when these disasters came in, I was forced to use them. I feel like I have to include a note with any check payments saying \"These are NOT counterfeit. I promise!\".

In some cases that may cause us to lighten the image more than our customers may expect, this may be what is causing the rust color you refer to.\nWe would like to work with you directly to determine if there could have been a quality issue with your order, we will have a customer service representative contact you by phone.",
