I don't have them, I have to now close my business account let ALL my auto withdrawals know and wait for a new account and start all over.....because no one knows where these checks are. Because the carrier says she delivered them, yet I have not received them. This company said all they can do is expedite shipping. I think $80+ is too much to spend for 200 checks so i can have small checks to carry wiyh me. So I will never use this compatible again! I will also let alll my family, friends, and any who asks where to go not to use this company as it is too much of a risk!",
