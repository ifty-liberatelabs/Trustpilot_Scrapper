I ordered 4 duplicate boxes of the lily of the valley checks and wish I had not  because the color was almost grey instead of bright green as it had appeared on line.  It was much lighter and faded almost grey.  I had assumed they would match the bright green check cover I ordered that was very nice.  The color is the only problem otherwise fine quality.",
