That was sneaky. I felt.   I did not expect to pay so much for the handling fee.  I don't think I will buy any checks again from Carousel, with that handling fee installed.  I will have to shop around and compare prices and make sure there are no handling fees and only fees that I have to pay should be listed.  But the checks and labels I bought are nice.  Can't complain about that.",

When I buy anything else on the planet except their checks, I see the price, then maybe a line for shipping, and maybe a line for tax.\n\nThese people add a \"Handling Fee\" which is not part of the product price.  It makes comparing prices difficult,and is itself deceptive because you can't buy the product without this handling charge, so it IS part of the price.\n\nI emailed my unhappiness, and got a call from somebody who told me her story or the company's story about why this makes sense to them.  I do not share their non-logic for this handling charge not being part of the price, and the caller stopped listening to me.  I hung up, which I rarely do.\n\nI will not buy anything from these folks ever.  Period.",
