Also, it took a very long time for the checks to arrive!  They were just as I had ordered which is good but I wouldn't recommend this company.\n- Now I will thank Carousel because after I posted this above, I received a credit for $8.95.  That means that my checks for $8.99 ended up costing $13.57.  I believe the additional $4.58 that I am charged is for a \"processing fee\"- still too high IMHO, but I expected to pay something for shipping, so I will look at this$4.58 as a shipping fee.",
