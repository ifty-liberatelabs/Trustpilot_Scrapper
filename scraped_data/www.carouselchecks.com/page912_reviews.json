My order has been in Dallas Tx for 4 days according to tracking, that is 3 hours from my home. Finally got email notice would be delivered tomorrow before end of day.  I will not reorder from this company will go back to previous company and pay alittle more for better service and customer appreciation. I have never in 15 years had this much trouble with getting my checks in the mail. Update per tracking was to be delivered by end of today and still no, hopefully tomorrow.
