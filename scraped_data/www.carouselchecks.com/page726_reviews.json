Federal Express lost 3 of the 4 boxes, plus they never found the checks! But Carousel Checks told me that I had received all the checks. Federal Express instead delivered  box #2 of my checks in a silver bag, not in the original box.The bag was taped shut. Federal Express never bothered to tell me that my other 3 boxes were missing.\n\nJoan, a supervisor at Carousel checks, who was apologetic and polite, was very helpful in providing  me  with necessary information. The original customer service rep was just going to make up a new batch of checks saying \"that the other checks are PROBABLY destroyed.\"  Meanwhile, someone could have had a great time cashing my missing checks!! Needless to say I cancelled them all!!",
