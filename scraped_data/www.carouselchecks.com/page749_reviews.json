I got charged for boxes to put the checks in that I didn't even order. You have hidden prices and I don't like that. I was so excited to see these checks, so it was a big let down. If I remember correctly it was 3 to 5 shipping days and I know it was longer than that. Good thing is I don't have to order from you the next time. Sincerely, Marcellus Gliha.",

Pricing is competitive - less than my bank charges for stock images. \n\nMy only quibble (and the reason for 4 stars rather than 5) is that when I first ordered from Carousel in 2007, the maximum quantity I could order was 1,200 checks. I re-ordered in 2013 and the maximum quantity I could order had dropped to 1,000 checks. Now it's down to 500 checks. I'd really appreciate it if there was still an option to purchase 1,200 checks at a time in one order rather than needing to place more frequent or multiple orders to get that quantity.\n\n From Carousel's perspective, I can't see that it incurs any significant additional cost to have that option available on its order site - all they'd need to do is add a few lines to the quantity choices and price the new options accordingly - but for perhaps the few people like me, it would be welcome.",
