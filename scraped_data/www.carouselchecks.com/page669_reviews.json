I called them and they gave me a deal that basically offset the charge so I was fine to continue with order, just noted how sketchy it was to add that kind of fee with no warning on site before checkout.   I ordered my checks Feb. 4th.. today is Feb. 26th AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT ARRIVED!!!!  I live about an hour away from the business.  I was originally told they would be here by or on Feb. 18th.  (Which was a holiday).  When they still did not arrive by days after that, I called again and was told they would be here the 23rd now.  Well, we are days past that again and when I called last night they said they would be here the 27th, now.  ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?! I was refunded $7 after they did not arrive the 18th, and was refunded another $7 last night, the 25th.  While I appreciate the attempt at trying to placate me, the $14 for my time spent on their hold line and impatiently waiting for the checks to arrive is kind of insulting at this point.  Like I said, I live an hour away from where they ship....it has been 3 weeks now and the checks are further from me on a Fed Ex bus than they were the minute I ordered. So unhappy with this company.",
