Turns out the prices at Carousel-the place Chase Bank uses, is the best price! The same order through Walmart was $72, I spent $21 at Carousel. For that I got 5 pads of checks, printed the exact way I requested, address labels, and a checkbook cover. Oh yeah, they were delivered on time. Bravo!",

        "text": "I was very disappointed that you wouldn't use the first picture that I submitted it kind of falls under freedom of religion. Yes I am a klansmen but I belong to the church of the American Christian Knights we are a religious order and we do a lot of work in our communities for everyone despite race,color,religious affiliation. By profiling and saying all klans are bad, it's like saying if you belong to the moose lodge or the elks club or the Masonic temple or the oddfellows lodge you are bad. It's no different than people saying if you're black you are a criminal and a drug dealer. Yes in past history klans were bad very bad,but times have changed! We are a Christian sect we work hard in our communities,we work with meat lockers and food pantries to provide for the less fortunate, and yes in my area it helps all races poor whites and less fortunate blacks and Hispanics. I raised five kids on a single income and I know how tough it is! Our communities know who we are and we have proven our good! Local meat lockers get ahold of us when they have a surplus and local grocery stores that ordered in to much or if products are coming up on expiration dates, they call us and we get the products where they are most needed,we have a family owned dairy that supplies milk and local farmers that supply produce and eggs. We have great relationships with local churches that contact us and tell us about families that are in dire straits and we reach out to our members and try to get the resources to make things happen. Anyone that we help knows where the help comes from and that a klansman helped make it possible. I've been in line at the grocery store and had people in front of me or behind me and I see them trying to figure out what they can pay for or if they need to put something back, I always tell the checker just to ring their order up with mine and I introduce myself and give them a business card and tell them I'm a klansman with the American Christian Knights and that it was truly my privilege to be able to help them. I have done that for every race. Poverty has no color! That's why I as wanting my picture on my check everyone I deal with financially knows who I am and what I do and they are all direct people in need my way. You can't help people if they don't know where to find you or how to get ahold of you.  I really wish you would reconsider the first picture that I submitted Sincerely Paul Peck (815)673-9706 thanks",
