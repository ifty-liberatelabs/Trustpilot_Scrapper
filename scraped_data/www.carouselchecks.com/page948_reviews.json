Issue was with the cover which was two small for the checks to fit in as I had ordered top stub checks (first time) I didn't have another cover to use. So I called customer service their thing was the cover had shrank because of cold weather and for me to stretch it out which I took a hair drier and tried but I was afraid to stretch any more now it has a ripple and the checks aren't fully covered. I believe the cover was made two small. The cover is very nice or I would have not tried to stretch it. As I write checks everyday the cover will not last and cover doesn't look professional. I'm looking for another cover. I use quite a few checks so I will need to order checks I will try another company. UPSP creased the other cover which I was able to get the crease out. The checks look good two bad the cover didn't fit. I think I shouldn't have to try to fix things. Outstanding customer Service  a refund and a new cover. When you have a problem it's how its handled that sets apart companies. Carousel is doing a great job 5 stars would not hesitate to buy again Thanks Carousel what a great company outstanding    Ron",

Two of the four bands did not survive the trip, so groups of checks were loose in bag. Bag arrived with a 1\" hole in it.  Some checks were bent. Previous vendor's checks were on thicker stock, with a heavier wire binding, and in real boxes. \"Handling Charge\" is a way to hide true cost of product from consumers and is rampant in the mail-order check game. Shameful practice should be banned. Although I did save a few bucks, I will not reuse this company.",
