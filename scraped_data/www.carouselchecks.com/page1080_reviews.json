I don't mind so much as I usually shred my checks now that the stores return them to the customer, but those that like to store them in boxes are very inconvenienced by that. I'm sure it was more cost-effective for the company to do this. All in all, I was happy w/the ordering & delivery & rec'd them in good time. I'll see how many more get jammed in registers before my next ordering of checks.",

On 12/18 I called you to check the status of my order because when I looked at the tracking there was no date for delivery. Your rep suggested call Fedex, so I did. Boy, what an ordeal. After spending 45 minutes and talking to 3 different people, I was told it was being sent to the US postal service and they should receive it by 12/24. And since it was now in the hands of the postal service, they(fedex) had no idea when it would be delivered. I called you back and spoke to a customer service rep and they were nice enough to credit me for the shipping and handling. I understand that this is a very busy time of year for shipping, but I really hope someone is already looking forward to next year to re-evaluate your shipping vendors and your policies informing your customers of possible delays.",
