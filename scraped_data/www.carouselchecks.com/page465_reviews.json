We ordered 500 printable checks for our business.  The checks came in a box, much larger than the checks themselves and not secured in any fashion.  The checks were loose in the box, along with four other smaller items I ordered.  Therefore, when we received the checks, they had slid all around in the box and were bent and wrinkled.  I had to try and lay them out flat and put weights on them so we can hopefully use them in the printer.  The print quality itself was also not as good.  Much lighter than previous orders making them hard to read.  Not the quality I expected after my previous two orders.",
