I selected 2 day delivery, and the contractor took it upon themselves to decide not to leave the package.  There was no pop up warning that this might be a possibility, and I certainly did not request that a signature be required.  Carousel Checks did try to follow up on it, but I still had to go to the shipping contractor's location to retrieve my package - which defeats the whole purpose of having something delivered to one's home.  Due to Carousel Check's choice of shipping contractor, and the lack of appropriate shipping options (2 day requiring signature/2 day no signature required), I will look for another vendor.",
