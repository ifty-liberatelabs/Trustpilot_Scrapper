I like that I can view the check as to how it will be printed to ensure everything is correct and the checks usually arrive within a week or two.  However, I do prefer the previous method of payment of direct ACH withdrawal over the new method of entering a check number; I feel as if this is a \"wasted\" check. Overall, I am completely satisfied with the quality of the checks I receive and will continue to use Carousel Checks for many more years to come.",
