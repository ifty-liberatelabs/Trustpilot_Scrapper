The customer service rep knew exactly what I was looking for and directed me to the area on the site where they had exactly what I wanted.  I placed my order and was pleasantly surprised at the excellent turn around time, as well as the quality of the product.  I will use Carousel Checks from now on, and avoid those grossly inflated prices the bank charges for new checks.  Thanks Carousel, you have a new, very satisfied customer!",
