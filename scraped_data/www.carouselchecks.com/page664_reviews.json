When I asked for an itemized receipt (the promo was buy 3 sets of checks and get one free), all I received was the total.  Representative contact was very polite.

High handling charge to add even more profit on to the already overpriced product.  The only thing positive I would say is that I paid for the free, slowest possible shipping and they still arrived very fast.  I would have been mad if I paid all the extra $ for \"expedited\" shipping and processing.  That would have bee a huge waste.  The only reason I ordered from them is they were the only ones who had this particular design.  This will be a one time order from them unless they have more reasonable prices next time.",
