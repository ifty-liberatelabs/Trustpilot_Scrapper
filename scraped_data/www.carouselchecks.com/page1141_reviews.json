Especially when it is twice as much as the shipping charge.  You figure it out and tell me that you'd he happy about charges that are not within reason.  Now you've received my only complaint with the good company I do business with.  It will be my last time... not because the product isn't good... it is, but because the handling fees are far too high.

I ordered one box of checks & the checks were priced right but when I went to check out, I found the amount of the shipping & handling charges come to more than my one box of checks. I had a coupon for free shipping but there was no where to enter it.This is ridiculous, so even though I am very pleased with the checks & service, I will not be ordering again. You are too greedy for me.",
