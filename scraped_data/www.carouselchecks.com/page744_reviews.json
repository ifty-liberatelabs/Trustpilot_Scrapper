Print time was excellent. \nCon: Because i went with the cheaper shipping, it took longer, and was not tracked as diligently as i would expect checks to be...and the books were not even boxed! \nEverything arrived fine and i may be expecting too much. Thank you for making ordering checks easy. If the cost for shipping included tracking and checks protected in a box, u would have 5 stars and a definite repeat customer.",
