First, the price you quote is not the price you pay at checkout.  Well, the price per check is, but they add additional charges on in the checkout process.  Perhaps this is standard, I don't know.  Second, when I received the checks, they fell out of the spiral binding.  I also was not happy with the quality of the paper and the look of the check.  Also, the quality of the leather cover I purchased along with the checks was not to my liking. So, next time I will try another vendor.",

Item did not arrive, checked tracking again. FedEx delivered it to my post office and the post office would be delivering it to my home. The post office is literally five minutes from my home. Still did not arrive on the provided date. Don't know why FedEx didn't deliver it directly, because FedEx does deliver in area, even on weekends.",
