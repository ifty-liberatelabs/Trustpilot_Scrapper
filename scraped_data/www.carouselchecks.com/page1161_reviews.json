I authorized payment for the order by echeck.  I did not receive the checks when I expected them and could not locate how to track the package, so I called your company and was told that \"In Plant Rush\" is only processed after the funds for payment have cleared and that if I had paid with a credit card, I would have received the order quicker.  The order/shipping process did not contain any of this information.  Although we did receive the new order before we ran out of checks (only had 5 checks left), I was very dissatisfied with the \"In Plant Rush\" that definitely was not an in plant rush.",

I put a rush on things because I was going out of town and I was out of check. I have paid every time with the e-check as I have every time and got the checks. When I placed the order on Monday it said I would receive them by Friday. Your payment was processed in my bank on Tuesday. I called customer service on Thursday to find out where my checks were she said payment cleared but checks will not be shipped until monday and I will not get them till Wednesday which was 5 days later than my so called rush service and shipping paid for.  Well Monday was too late I was already on my way out of town with no checks. After this experience I will not return. I will be looking for someone else to service my check needs.",
