And since I was going to pay for them either way, I decided why not try & find a vendor w/a larger selection of check designs/styles, never mind, maybe slightly cheaper pricing than Harland.  Well, there were plenty of online vendors from which to choose.  I settled on Carousel Checks, as they seemed to have a pretty large selection of check designs/styles & their pricing was cheaper than Harland's.\r\n\r\nAll seemed O.K. in terms of choosing a design/style of checks, then registering for an account on their website, inputting my personal/banking info, etc., etc., then choosing how I wanted my check reorder delivered (I chose \"basic\" delivery, which was via FedEx Smartpost  --  5-10 business days delivery) & opted to pay for the check reorder via ACH withdrawal directly from my bank acct., as they already had all my banking info. anyway.\r\n\r\nWell, roughly 2 weeks later, no FedEx shipping updates (only the same initial info., indicating that a FedEx label had been generated by the shipper), so I called Carousel Checks (on a Friday) to check on my order status.  I was told that I should try & call FedEx to ask them to check on my order status b/c they showed that the shipment was sent out on the day after the initial FedEx label-generated, shipping update.  After talking w/FedEx, they indicated that they only showed the same info. that I had seen on their tracking page, i.e. FedEx label generation by shipper & no further info.  They recommended calling the vendor back & asking them to call FedEx directly to help expedite FedEx's Smartpost division confirm/deny their parcel's entry into the FedEx delivery system & an official FedEx tracking inquiry for the parcel's tracking # was officially opened by FedEx.  So I called Carousel Checks back & asked them to please follow-up w/FedEx, so they could further expedite the tracking inquiry & determine if the parcel was indeed lost somewhere in the FedEx system.  The customer service rep. informed me that since it was the end of the business day on Friday, that they would follow-up w/FedEx on the following Monday.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, I first received a voicemail from FedEx, indicating that they had spoken w/Carousel Checks & had determined that the parcel in question never actually entered into their delivery system, i.e. it was never made available for pick-up, subsequent to the original FedEx label generation.  Later I received a voicemail from Carousel Checks, indicating that they were just going to \"reprint\" my original check order & upgrade my original delivery option to FedEx 2-day delivery, so that I would receive them before the end of that business week.  They, however, gave no indication that they would try to ascertain the whereabouts of my \"original\" order, so I actually had to call Carousel Checks back to find out if they were actually going to try & find my \"original\" order.  I almost didn't want them to reprint my \"original\" order unless I knew for a fact that my \"original\" order's whereabouts were known, as I didn't want to worry about the\"original\" order, presumably \"duplicate\" checks either being di/subverted to somewhere else/by someone else & maybe having my identity stolen.  Come to find out that the original customer service rep. that I had been dealing w/the previous Friday was not in the office, so my phone call was not returned for an additional business day.  When it was actually returned, it was by a different customer service rep. who left a voicemail, indicating that the other rep. had been out of the office & she finally saw that I had left a message & she informed me that when the other service rep. had requested a \"reprint\" of my \"original\" order, she had also requested that my \"original\" order be shredded, as apparently it had never been shipped out!  Unless there was a delay in actually physically locating my \"original\" order, why would you just \"reprint\" the \"original\" order & ship it out (2-day, expedited shipping or otherwise) w/o being able to locate/verify the existence of the \"original\" order, so you would be able to then ensure its actual/proper destruction?!  And if you actually did locate/verify the existence of the \"original\" order, why would you need to \"reprint\" it and/or expedite the delivery of said \"reprint\" order?!\r\n\r\nI actually did finally receive the FedEx'd (2-day delivered) \"reprint\" of the \"original\" order, but I'm not all that confident about using them, nor am I 100% confident that my personal/banking info. is actually secure/safe!!  This whole experience w/Carousel Checks has been rather upsetting & stressful, so I'm not sure I would recommend them as a reliable online check reordering service.  Their web-site looks/ed legit, but their parent company, Parker Machines, a privately-owned, family-run business has only been in existence on the Southside of Chicago, IL since sometime in 2003 after which they state that they evolved/developed into Carousel Checks, but they don't actually indicate when that occurred.",

Most sites had 70 to 100 options but none of them said \"WOW\" that I was looking for in the checks for my new business.  Carousel had LOTS of \"WOW\" available for the really discriminating or picky art lovers that want their checks to truly speak for them personally or for their business.  The arrived quickly and I found an error in my business name.  I called to ask what their procedure was and they were able to establish it was on their part so they reprinted the checks and shipped them at no cost to me as quickly as possible.
