However, their packaging and shipping policies can lead to damage or theft of checks and exposure of clients' banking information which is of utmost concern.  The reordered checks are not packaged in a box or even an interior plastic bag, just stuck in a flimsy shipping package that can be easily torn by postal sorting equipment. There is just a thin plastic band around each package of checks.  On the outside, it is clearly labelled as being from Carousel CHECKS, thus further alerting potential identity thieves of package contents.  The potential for identity risk is too great to order from this company again, which is too bad because I liked the checks.  I will get them from Harlan, who are much more security conscious, for now on.",
