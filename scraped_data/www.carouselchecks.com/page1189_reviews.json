I was contacted by a rep of your company and we decided to delete the computer checks. Which would make my bill cheaper. I was under the impression that they were canceled. The next morning I checked my account and there was a charge on my account for more than what I was to pay. I placed a call and spoke to what I thought was a competent person and told them not to charge my account again, I then aid for the checks with my credit card. The next morning I checked my account and there was another charge on there for even more this time than the last one. I made a call and was promised that it would be taking care of. Because my business account was a new account, open for one day, the closed my account because your company tried to charge me 3 times. Charging me like you did, caused my account to overdraw and being a new account, 2 days old, the closed my account. Now I have checks that are no good. I have spent almost $100.00 for the checks to have to shred them and throw away everything. Your company is nothing more than a scam and you charge people more than what they are supposed to be charged and then say, oh, we are so sorry, we will give you a credit that never comes. I thing you owe me the money for the checks that I cannot use. I would rather you credit it to me before I notify the card issuer and tell them that it was a fraudulent charge and have them come after you and get my money back that way. I feel that I am deserved an apology as well. I am going to advertise this on Angie's list and everywhere else I can.",
