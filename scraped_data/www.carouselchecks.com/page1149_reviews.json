I've had the same design for probably 4 yrs (Yorkies).  When I went to look for them, there they were.  Then I took another look & there was an even cuter Yorkie design!!  I got a combo bundle, 1 box of duplicate checks, 144 matching address labels, & a black leather checkbook cover for about $30.  There was a bit of a problem with my bank card as the bank's computer didn't recognize my new address, even tho I had called the bank to change the address the day before.  Carousel worked with me & ended up taking it straight out of my bank account. It didn't take long before they shipped my order.   \r\nWithin a few days everything arrived. Everything looks great & there are no mistakes,  just as I've come to expect.  I don't expect to have to order checks again in at least a few years, but when I do, it'll be front Carousel!!!  Thank you everyone!!",
