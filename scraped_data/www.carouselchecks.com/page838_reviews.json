Panicking that I would receive a whole box of new checks with the wrong numbers on them, I called customer service and was kindly assured that they would shred my new checks and reprint them with the correct numbers before shipping them to me. I was pleasantly surprised at the warmth of their staff and their eagerness to help.",
