She offered to remove shipping charges because of the delay, and even offered to re-print the checks.  We decided to wait a few days, and the checks did eventually show up.  (While we were waiting for the delivery, we received a notice from the post office that they had attempted to deliver the package, but they \"could not access the delivery location.\"  Have no idea what this meant, because our mailbox is always totally accessible, with no parked cars around it.  And we were home, if they needed to knock on the door.  Anyway, Marcia called about that message too, to help try to figure out what was going on.  So overall, there was some inconvenience and delay, but I suppose that was out of Carousel's control, and they were very good about helping us with the problem.)",
