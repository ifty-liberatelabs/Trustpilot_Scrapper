I thought the price listed was for the entire bundle but found out each item had a different price that added to the bundle.  Prices were still pretty good but was confused as I took out one of the bundled items and then couldn't get the bundle price back.  So, one of our accounts was at the discount bundle price, the other I had to take off the envelopes to save money and went with the unbundled price.  Still it was overall a good experience and they arrived in a timely manner.",
