        "text": "I have ordered business and personal checks from Carousel Checks in the past.  Checks are always exactly what I wanted and a quality product.  This last order, I caught myself and ran short of checks.  I placed an order online and paid via thru my checking account, thinking this would expedite the order, and 2 Day Fed Ex service so I could have them prior to having to do payroll. WRONG!  When I called to see where the checks were I was told by the agent that direct pay thru my business checking account delayed the process 3 days - nowhere one their order form is this information disclosed, or I would have put it on my credit card.  2 Day Fed Ex really doesn't mean two days either - it's 2 business days, but can take between 3 to 5 to receive. I asked the customer service agent to pass on the information to a tech person that they really needed to disclose the information on their online order form.  She couldn't help and told me to write a letter to supervisor, which I did, but to date, no reply.   Lesson learned - I now have a colored sheet of paper when I am down to my last 100 checks - no longer going to order online but going to call in the order so I can talk to a customer service agent so I can get the checks when I need them and not have them delayed.",
