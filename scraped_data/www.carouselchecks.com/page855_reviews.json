My tracking notification told me they were unable to deliver and were sending the package back to the shipper! Personal checks floating around who knows where in the USPS system was not acceptable!!  I called the post office that delivers my mail and was able to have them pull the package from being returned and I made a special trip to the post office to pick it up.
