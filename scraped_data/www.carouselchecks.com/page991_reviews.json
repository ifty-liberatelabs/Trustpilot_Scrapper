By the end of the week had my checks , and was able to pay my bills on time. My friends was asking where I got my checks , they was getting them from there bank , was paying their the bank high price , so I told them about Carousel check, and told them they had large selection that u can choose from. The only downside was that top  and desk stay need to come I more of a selection. I love the hot balloon style and it didn't come in that style . But I was please with my order. And would recommend this company to my friend s  and will  keep order from this company.",

They are sending me replacement checks at no cost that will fix the tear off issue.  \nIn fairness to them, I originally wrote this without having first given them the chance to correct the problem.  Therefore, I will increase my rating provided the new checks fix the issue and there are no new problems to address.\n\nOriginal post:\nThe whole process of designing my photo checks was great and easy.  \n\nThe one problem and was a big one was that  the checks do not tear out very easily.  You end up with a \"hanging chad\" where it pulls out by the staple and not along the perforation.  Otherwise you end up tearing the top of the check.  They should get a new binder supplier or let them fix it but otherwise the photos were beautiful.",

        "text": "Like most companies, Carousel has devised a scheme to mislead buyers by advertising really low prices, then adding a handling fee at the end. So, for my $6.99 box of checks, the handling fee is $3.45, a 49% increase in the cost of the checks. Since when are normal companies charging handling fees? And to get free shipping, you have to wait 12-21 days for USPS to deliver. Otherwise, you'll pay $4.99 minimum for some other method of shipping. It's a good thing I write a check about once every four months. These checks should last me a while.",
