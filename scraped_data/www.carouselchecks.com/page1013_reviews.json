Checks were not boxed, just put in a shipping bag and sent. This makes Storage a difficulty and some of them were bent in odd ways. I would be afraid that if the bag was damaged some of the contents would be easily lost or stolen!\nThe checks were fine in all other ways as far as I could tell.\n\nDon't think I would order from Carousel Checks again.",
