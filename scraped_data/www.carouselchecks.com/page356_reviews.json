At the very last second they slip in a mere $7.20 for HANDLING (Don't you have employees who are paid to process these orders? Why do we have to pay their hourly wage to get our goods?) AND $8.95 for SHIPPING. I'm in a business where I ship product every day and two little boxes of checks nowhere on earth cost $8.95 to ship. SO yeah, I think this is a huge BAIT AND SWITCH. Those checks had better be damn beautiful!!!\nUPDATE: after my review a customer service representative from Carousel Checks contacted me immediately left a voicemail that they would be refunding both the shipping charge as well as a discount on the checks, which I DID receive. Then, I received 4 books of checks when I only ordered 2 so I guess that was a compensation as well. So good for Carousel and their excellent customer service—very much appreciated…AND, now y’all know to expect those extra charges!",
