        "text": "Being a nonprofit organization price is always a big concern so when it came time for us to place an order I shopped around.  Carousel Checks was the least expensive plus I was able to find a coupon for $25 off via the Honey website. After all the information was entered and I was proofing the end result I had a few questions so I used the chat service and was connected with your agent Nicole Lee.  She was extremely helpful with the order process, answering every question and being patient with me while I verified everything.  Once the order was placed I noticed that the $25 off coupon wasn't applied so I emailed her and she was able to issue a credit to our account for that amount.  The checks also came very quickly and looked amazing.  I will definitely recommend your company to anyone needing to order checks for either business or personal use.  \nThank you again.",
