The order was shipped in a plastic bag and the boxes were beat up, crushed, and out of shape when they arrived. The boxes weren’t that expensive but I was charged for each of those boxes individually and would liked to have received them in new condition. It seems obvious to me that a plastic bag is not going to protect a cardboard check box during shipping. If a customer ordered a single book or something, maybe throw it in a bag and hope for the best is reasonable... but with an order this size they could could do better with packaging and protecting the items for shipping.\n\nEdit: 4/28/2021 - After leaving the above review at 3 stars, the company shipped me 4 new check boxes with better packaging this time. Will change to 4 stars as I appreciate the extra effort to make it right, can’t do 5 stars because it wasn’t packaged right the first time.",

The only issue I have is with the paper used for the checks...it is much heavier than I am accustomed to using and when tearing out the check, I have yet to have one tear out cleanly.  They are not perferated very well and the heaverier paper doesn't tear at the perforation causing for a very bad top edge.  Just because of this issue, I will not recommend purchasing these checks!",
