(I chose the Creepy Kids design). I received my address labels first and everything looked great except one thing. The lining of the sheets were off, so the writing at the top of my chosen design was cut in half and it left a huge blank space underneath my address. I suppose that wouldn't be a huge deal for most, but part of the reason I chose that design was for one of the images and now you won't be able to read what it says once you use it. I will still use them, but I just wanted to make note of the small annoyance. The checks were perfect when they arrived. One thing that threw me off was that I never got an email letting me know my order had shipped. I assumed I would. Again, not a huge deal.",
