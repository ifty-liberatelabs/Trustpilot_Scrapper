I suggest that your website be changed because when you look at \"What's Included?\", the verbiage says 5 pads per box.  So a customer would think the box is included.  The website should probably say, \"5 pads per bundle\" or something similar instead of \"box\".\n\nAlso your site should have said something about handling as an additional charge with shipping BEFORE checking out to pay.\n\nMy rating would have been higher if I didn't have to contact the company and the website was clearer about ALL charges before checking out.",

We did not pay for the additional tracking fee(too much money for checks on a budget!) and were basically told that it was our fault! When I stated to the representative how I felt the fee was outrageous, he sarcastically told me that it's a business! I explained my limited budget and extreme dissatisfaction with him as well as the check ordering process as well as the thought to cancel my order....his reply was, \"is that what you want to do?\". How about that for customer service?! The checks were \"reprinted\" and sent as a rush order without any tracking service provided or suggested unless I wanted to \"pay for the service\". I would NEVER, NEVER order from Carousel Checks again!! Checks are certainly more affordable with other companies.",

I think what disappointed me more was when I called customer service to reorder, the sales person blamed me for the mistake. When I designed the check there is a proofread section in which I accepted. There's a chance for the first time in 21 years together that I spelt my wife's name wrong but I truly don't think so. With that said new checks have arrived, look nice and may reorder when these are nearly all used. Thank you",
