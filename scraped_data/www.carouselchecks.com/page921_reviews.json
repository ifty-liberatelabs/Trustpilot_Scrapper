Without reservation she said they would simply print the checks again with my new bank info.  I only had to pay for the new shipping.  I offered to refuse the order when it arrived so that it would simply come back to them and she just told me to shred them.  I call that excellent customer service.  I have told many people over the last week about my experience and have recommended them to buy their next set of checks from them.  In the meantime, I received the first set and was able to see the quality that I am going to receive when I get the new set.  I am very pleased and so you will be too!",

I purchased it. Many weeks later I received the checks in a box that was just a plain Carousel box, not matching the checks.  I had to laugh at how petty it was to try to get .49 out of the consumer for a plain box. I have a family of 5, all who use checks. You lost my business on that one. The money is no issue, the deceit, however, is. Congratulations!",

We do not offer matching check boxes but we do offer matching labels and covers and we are sorry that a suggestion on the site was misinterpreted. With regards to the box itself, we do offer them at $.49 as an optional feature since many customers prefer to do without the box. Should you wish to discuss you concerns with us please feel free to contact our customer service department at 708-613-2452 and select option 2. \n\nWe appreciate your business and value your feedback. \n\nKindest Regards,\nCarousel Checks",
