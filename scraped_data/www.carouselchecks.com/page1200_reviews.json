I ordered bulk delivery on the 26th of February, as i was not in a great hurry for my checks.  I just received them on the 23rd of March; good thing i was not in a hurry for them.  \r\nI ordered checks for our business from another on line company, and had almost as much trouble paying for them, and receiving them.  \r\nFrom now on, i will order my checks directly from the bank.

I was not happy and even had 2 businesses not accept my checks,so I called to see if they would redo them. They said they would look into it,but only if I sent a copy of the check to them. That is more time and money on me for THEIR mistake! You would think a company would make it right for their mistake and not make the customer put more time and money into it. NOT happy and will NEVER purchase through them again. I did not send the check,I refuse to wait that long,and dont think they are worth my time. I re-ordered through a trustworthy company and just ate the cost sadly even though I feel it is so wrong! I wish this review had the option to share photos...",
