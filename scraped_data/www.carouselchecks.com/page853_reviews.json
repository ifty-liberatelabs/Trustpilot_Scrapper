She told me that I would have to pay to ship it back and then pay shipping on the new one, but that we were even and I didn't owe anymore!  The wrong one was $19.99 and I paid $16. shipping..the new one was only 9.99. When I protested that it was Carousel's mistake, not mine, she put me on hold for a long time.  When she came back, she told me that she talked with her supervisor and also checked the website and it does indeed suggest the wrong cover, so I could just keep the binder or mail it back and they would be sending me the new cover at no charge.  There was no mention of a refund of the $10. difference but I was so aggravated by then, I just let it go.  I was not satisfied with the whole experience though.",
