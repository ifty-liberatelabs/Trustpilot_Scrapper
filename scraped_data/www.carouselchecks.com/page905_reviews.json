The excellent professional person  at  Carousel office on the phone  was  well spoken and accurate in taking our information & offering the various options available.  She was clear and communicated clearly to explain everything properly . She made sure that I understood the terms of the purchase and that everything would be prepared and ready. And speaks perfect English . ( Another different company , that I had contacted earlier in the day did not speak good English at all , and I had extreme difficulty hearing or understanding their English , so therefore,  I could  not place an order with them at all for this type of product which needs to be perfectly accurate , or the product would be  totally useless .)   Then good fortune, that I found and called Carousel. As first time customers, what  a relief to find a company like this one , at the other end of the phone line, when we  needed a supply to find this gem of a business like  company runned  like Carousel.  The product shipped to us was perfect. The product arrived on time.  Also  your Customer Service Representative was professional , calm, patient, and courteous . Things were done the good old fashioned  sensible way.  Everything ran smoothly and we got our order and the value price was very good. As a customer it was a tremendous relief , so to say that  this really made our day , and the entire good  shopping experience for our family . Thank You.",
