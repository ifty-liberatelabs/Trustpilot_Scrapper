The company requires you to provide all personal information for the checks (email, address, phone, bank account numbers) before revealing that there are separate charges for shipping, handling, taxes, and they also have a minimum order amount. I thought I was going to save money but it ended up costing me more. Once they had all my info, I just processed the order rather than gve another company all my personal info. The checks took a long time to arrive because of the processing and then the shipping time.  And the quality is poor, they look cheap ...  I think I could have printed nicer checks on my laser printer. I will not order from them again and definitely do not recommend.",

And is it necessary to have your business name in the return address.

The post office convinced me that the bag had caught on a piece of machinery, and they were fairly certain no person had stolen my info, but can you really be too careful these days?",
