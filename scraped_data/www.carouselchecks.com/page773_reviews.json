When I got them they looked bad like there was a printing problem, They were faded out and one design wasn't recognizable as a dog. I called and talked to one of your reps and she was very nice but told me there had been a change from the banks and they couldn't print them as dark anymore. She even talked to a supervisor but told me there was nothing they could do. I went back to your site and they are not shown there as looking like the ones I got. If this is how they are going to look from now on, you need to show that when someone orders them. I probably won't use these checks, was disappointed with how they looked.",
