I called and explained the situation and was told they would look into color correcting the design and get back to me.  The next day I received a message telling me that the image is as dark as possible and could not be made any darker but that they would gladly offer me a replacement printing of a different design at no charge.  I am very satisfied with their resolution but I cannot understand why they even offer the design I initially ordered if they can't get them any darker than they are.",
