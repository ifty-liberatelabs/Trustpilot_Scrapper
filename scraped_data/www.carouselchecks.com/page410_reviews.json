I feel like I have my own personal assistant and I appreciate everything he helps me with. I do not take him for granted because we are living in times now where now you can barely understand the customer service rep who is trying to help you which makes it even more difficult and frustrating.  He understands me, he is very polite and respectful at all times and he always return my calls promptly.  I don't know what I'd do if Bill wasn't with this company any longer or you guys folded but I'm praying none of that happens.  I enjoy your services and the cost is affordable for my clients.  There are no hassles and he gets the job done.  Thank you so much!",
