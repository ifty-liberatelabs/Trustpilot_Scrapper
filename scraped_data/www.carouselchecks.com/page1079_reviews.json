I was surprised when informed, after the person I reached checked with a supervisor, that I would have to mail back the checkbook cover I received before the correct cover could be shipped.  \r\nI feel Carousel could've been more accommodating than having me first validate an error had occurred before the error would be handled, allowing me to finally receive what I'd already paid for.  \r\nThis wasn't the first time I'd ordered from Carousel which Carousel was aware of by my reordering checks as well, and I would've appreciated Carousel extending some trust to a repeat customer by rushing the correct cover to me.  After all, I feel I'm being asked as a customer to share in the responsibility for the mistake by finding time in my busy schedule to get to the post office, further delaying the completion of my transaction given Carousel's policy.  If this was simply a matter of my being displeased with what I ordered and wanting a refund, I could more easily accept Carousel's requirement, but I don't see this as being the case. \r\nI began on a positive note and it's my pleasure to end on one.  Carousel's representatives were so delightful that I told them Carousel must be a wonderful company to work for because they sounded like they truly enjoyed their work.\r\nI will continue to use Carousel.

My only suggestion would be to visually look at the checks before sending out as it would have only taken a few seconds to see the original order was not right to begin with. Luckily, I had checks to last me to the end of Jan 2016 so it was no problem for me.

All I did was place a reorder and since they printed the last batch they know what numbers they had printed.  If somehow I entered an incorrect start number perhaps its because their web site is not bullet proof and it allows these type errors.  They ultimately should have known they already had printed the same series of check numbers.  A 'reorder' should be foolproof.  \r\n\r\nTheir customer service was very pleasant but they wanted me to pay for shipping and handling on the replacement order whereby they come out whole and I lose another $10 or so.  On top of that the checks cost double what I paid for the previous order.  Come on folks.",
