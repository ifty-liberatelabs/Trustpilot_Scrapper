        "text": "First of all, the pictures on the address labels (lighthouses) are a little too dark, but it is not a big problem as the address is on a white background. Secondly, I think almost $58 for 150 checks is a little steep (there were no add-ons for special printing, check fraud protection,etc.) especially since there are no boxes anymore. They just come in a plastic bag. I am so tired of companies passing charges on to their customers that used to be absorbed as a \"cost of doing business\".\nOn the order before this one, the checks started with the wrong number (numbers were a reprint of my last order, so I had already used checks with those numbers).. I called customer service and after I presented my problem, was told I could have a \"partial credit\" on my next order. No. I wanted the checks printed with the numbers I requested, but had to speak to a supervisor before I could get them reprinted at no additional charge. It wasn't my mistake. Why not just admit it was the company's and reprint the checks?",

My son ended up receiving them at his trailer a couple of weeks later. I will never do business with them again. My questions were not top secret info.
