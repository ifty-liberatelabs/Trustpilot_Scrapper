I had to call them and was told that my order had been flagged for verification and that they would send me an email with a request to verify my address. They also said their team has many orders, which is understandable, but why offer a rush fee if such service is non-existent? So, they didn't bother to let me know about this until I called. I asked to cancel the order and will never do business with this company again.",
