I actually telephoned my order into customer service who was informative, friendly and professional!.  Because I wanted to order an additional 100 checks from the typical order, it was easier to call in toll free AND SO GLAD I DID! BECAUSE OF MY EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE.  Will recommend to friends and family!",
