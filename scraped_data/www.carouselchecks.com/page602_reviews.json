        "text": "Ordered some quarter wrappers. Website was efficient, and acknowledged order. Shipping was extremely slow. Took over a week for some one to simply pull item from shelf and prepare for shipping. \nIt took over 2 more weeks for the item to arrive. Item was handed over to DHL, who further handed item over to us postal service at some point in it's journey to me. I dont know why carousel checks could not simply put the item in an envelope, drop it off at the post office and send it on its way. Post office usually delivers an envelope from any point in USA in 2 to 3 business days, some times 4 days. That is just regular mail nothing special or expensive. \nwhat is the purpose of having multiple people handling the item to be shipped? in-efficient. also when I order something online I expect it to be pulled immediately from shelf and sent on its way. No dicking around for a week, then pulling item. i am reasonable and can understand that some times I may need to wait for the next business day if ordering something after business hours, or late in the day. But dicking around for a week prior to shipping? come on, get it together.",
