The result is a $28+ charge after I called in per their directions...... and they say that I can no longer see what the original entry I made as it automatically changed when I called to ask for reprint.

        "text": "Update 8/1/2017 Bill from customer service called and said they would refund my money for the QUOTE HANDLING FEE and gave me a B.S. excuse why they want to mislead customers. What they do is false and deceptive trade practices. Bill said allot of manual labor goes into binding the checks and deposit tickets which requires the \"special handling fee\" Bill here is a fair and honest way of doing business adjust your prices and honor your free shipping that is advertised and don't mislead customers that way you don't get bad reviews. I would rather pay more and get my free shipping and deal with a company that has honest advertising then be lied to at check out after spending 30 min entering all my companies info.\nI do appreciate you refunding the \"Handling Fee\"\n \nThe reason I ordered deposit tickets from your company was you offered free shipping and many other companies charged high shipping fees. So I spent allot of time entering all my data for my 4 companies and when I went to pay the shipping was free but you charged a service charge which is total B.S. I would have cancelled my order but it took me to long to enter the data. I will NEVER order again and have posted your B.S. business practices on YELP and will continue on facebook, google and others warning people that just pisses me off more then you even know.",
