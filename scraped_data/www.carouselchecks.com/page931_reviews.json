I wish there was a few more options in font, size, spacing or spelling out lane, road or your state to more customize your check and show exact placement. My city, state look smashed together. Probably the font style. Would have been nice to review  what the end result would look like and alter better. Not alot of new choices or unique choices but I guess thats the designer since a lot of companies seem to have the same styles. All designs should be available in any format though. Side tear, top, desk, dup, or even electronic. It would be really nice if there was lots more scenery changes through the books, like a dozen pictures instead of three, kind of like a desk calendar new picture each day. Especially in things like animals, flowers, landscaped and Thomas kinkade's. Unique & variety is cool, especially with checks if you don't write a lot of them. Maybe the printing  doesn't  have the ability to do that. And software that lets you do a little more font and style and spacing without ruining the Integrity of the check. Just something to stand out apart from the rest. The service was great. Like I said they caught my bank changing the way account numbers were and I never knew that. That alone impressed me it was worth the couple day wait to get it right.",
