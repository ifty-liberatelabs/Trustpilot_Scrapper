        "text": "The price and designs (quality and variety) are great.  I will definitely use Carousel Checks again because I found a design that I absolutely love.  BUT... there were a few things I had known in the beginning and I think would be helpful to potential customers.  \n\n#1 - They charge an automatic handling fee of $6.90 (for two boxes) that isn't disclosed upfront.  You only find this out when you get to the payment page.  I would have canceled the order, but the only check design that I absolutely love was on their site.  For someone that isn't as picky as I am when it comes to design, and price is an issue for you, there are other check printing services that disclose all fees upfront.  In my opinion it would be a better practice to disclose the fee upfront, or remove it all together (even if it involves slightly increase the price of the checks) so there will be no surprises... Consumers hate surprises! Haha!  \n\n#2 - I didn't realize the checks do not come with a checkbook cover.  Not even the cheap, flimsy, vinyl checkbook cover that comes with checks from most other companies.  They were too busy trying to convince me to purchase an expensive one that had I known I wasn't getting a cheap vinyl one, then I probably would have paid the extra $1.99.  Instead, I refuse to order one now because I will have a handling fee of $1.99 and a shipping fee of $4.99.  I will order a checkbook cover elsewhere since my old cover is falling apart.\n\n#3 - I chose the free shipping option.  I just didn't realize that they would use the entire 10 days to process the order and an additional 7 days for shipping.  I actually take the blame for this because I chose the free shipping, but I'm not used to major companies taking 10 days to process an order regardless of if they state it upfront.  But again, this is just something to be mindful of for potential customers... they truly take the maximum number of days allowed.\n\nLastly, this is one pro based on other reviews on the site.  Many mentioned the quality of the images and paper used for printing was poor.  This actually had me a bit concerned because I read the reviews AFTER I placed my order.  Maybe I lucked up because the image and paper quality I received was great!  The checks didn't look or feel any differently than other checks that I have ordered from my bank.  I'm thinking the customers that posted bad reviews received a bad stock of checks because my image quality was great (and yes, they note on the website that the color has been enhanced on the picture, but the printed color was very close to what was on the screen).  \n\nOverall, the price and design are great.  But as a word of caution for people that are extremely cost-conscious, there will be a handling fee tacked on to your order at the very end and you will not receive a free basic vinyl checkbook cover with your order.",
