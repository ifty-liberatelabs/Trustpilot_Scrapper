I was expecting a personal size checkbook, so I called and they said they could reprint them, so I agreed. The lady could not retrieve our logo from the first check order so sent her two, one with a transparent background and one not transparent. She automatically used the non transparent background. The checks have a blue marble background. I now have this big white block behind behind our logo and it does not look good at all. They look as if I ordered them from amateurs, well I guess I did.\n\nOn the third try this company printed the checks correctly. I wrote this review and received a phone call from them directly and they made it right. A big thank you to them, I was getting ready to reorder checks from another company! I have raised the it to a 4 star because they fixed the problem.",
