They fold up and tuck down into a back pocket instead of sticking out where they can be picked. Like the looks of the checks except for the deposit slip stubs. They are just a copy of the check stubs, should be worded diffrently. There should also be more deposit slips in each stack, like maybe 8 or 10 per 50 checks instead of just 4. Overall I am pleased with them.",
