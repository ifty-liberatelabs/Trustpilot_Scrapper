When I called the customer service rep complaining about this, she made it sound like I made the mistake. She was willing to reprint the check with my correct account number, but I was made to pay the expensive shipping, which was around $12. I think CarouselChecks should ask us to upload a voided copy of our existing check to avoid this type of error. Also, they should offer an option of lower cost of shipping method. The $12 shipping is their lowest shipping method. Not all customers want their checks received within a week.",
