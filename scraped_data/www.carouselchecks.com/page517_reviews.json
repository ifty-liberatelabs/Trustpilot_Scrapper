Under the shipping area you have a 2 day rush, but that is for in house processing only, but it gives you the impression that it is for shipping so this is totally misleading.  You need to specify that it is for making of the checks and not the shipping.  We really needed these check right away and it took almost two weeks by the time DHL flew them around the world and back.  Kinda crazy.  If the checks really were sent out in two days then there is no reason they should take that long to get to us.  I think that is ridiculous.  Just saying.",
