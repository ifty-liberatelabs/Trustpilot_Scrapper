You can barely see the monogram is an \"S\" in the center. I expected more detail I guess. To me it just looks like a beige check with a seashell. I should have reordered/duplicated my last order of parrots (lots of color and the birds were gorgeous).\n...2 days later \nI am updating my comment for a number of reasons, but mostly because Carousel has great customer service which is hard to find these days.\nThey care what we think.\nI wasn't happy with the checks I received, they offered to make them work for me (more color in the design) AND at no charge and we are going to work this out together.\nI feel like I've given you the wrong idea about Carousel. I've used them for over 20 years and have been totally satisfied with their products until now. I really appreciate their concern and their reaching out to me to make it better. I love color, I should have ordered something else, I didn't, it is what it is. I will continue to use them in the future and will choose a better design to suit my tastes. \nThank you Carousel",

        "text": "I am a first time customer of Carousel Checks and I didn't have any trouble with the way my account was handled.  I received the checks in a very timely manner.\n\nI've used \"Top Stub\" checks for decades and ordered four boxes and a leather cover from Carousel - just to try them out.  \n\nFirst, the Carousel advertisements indicate that you are ordering \"boxes\" of checks.  There are no \"boxes\" - the checks are shipped loose.  Makes it a little hard to store the stubs for future reference.\n\nSecond, the back page of the each book of checks(which is supposed to be stuffed into the cover) is so flimsy that it was impossible to insert it into the cover.  I returned the leather cover and did receive a timely credit.  \n\nThird, my existing checks are punched 9 times across the top with a fairly small wire binding.  Carousel checks are punched 16 times and bound with a wire binder that has a diameter so large that it doesn't fit well into a checkbook cover. \n\nFourth, I'm not a student of Carousel's business plan, but it can't be cost prohibitive to provide boxes for the checks and a generic plastic checkbook cover. \n\nI probably will not order checks from Carousel again but only because the product design is only marginally acceptable.  Competitors have more appropriate top stub products at competitive prices.  However, I did receive very responsive action on the part of the Carousel folks who probably didn't have anything to do with the product design.  So, I would give the Carousel people 5 stars and the product a 1.",

Very light colored don't even look red, white and blue. Very bad quality for the price i paid. Sorry i ordered 4 boxes was expecting them to look like what was advertised. Would not order again.",

Great company and wonderful CSR.  And the order was perfect!",
