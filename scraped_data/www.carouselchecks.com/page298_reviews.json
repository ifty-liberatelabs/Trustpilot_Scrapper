It claims to be leather but it feels like cheap vinyl. The calculator is something you’d get from the .99 cents store but .99 cents store calculators are actually better. The problem with the calculator is that you have to depress the button with alot of pressure so at times it doesn’t take the number you’re trying to press so you’d have to start all over if you don’t catch the error. The date and time doesn’t set after I had to reset the calculator because the balance for the checking wouldn’t adjust accordingly. So I requested a replacement for the calculator and awaiting for shipment. If the calculator still malfunctions the same way, I will do a complete return on the check book wallet with calculator",

I want to order check registers with large print which the registers are only $6.99 but they want to charge $10.56 for shipping.  Why would I pay that for shipping when the item I want is $6.99.  I tried clicking on Rush Job for $4.99 but it won't take the $10.56 off so I would end up paying more money $24.12.  That is crazy!!!\n2/3/22\nI haven't placed the order because Im not paying $10.56 for shipping on a $6.99 item.  I was just commenting on it but if there is something you can do, please let me know.
