However, shortly a few days later someone hacked into my account. They had access to bank account and routing number. The person had access to my info and paid their Comcast bill and set it up as a Monthly payment. I am always very careful with my information. Therefore, I can only believe that with ordering checks and printing perhaps that is how this individual has my information and took advantage. I thankfully picked up on it and quickly called my bank. Please make sure that all your customers information is handled with the utmost security so this if it truly happened with an individual at your Company doesn’t happen again.",
