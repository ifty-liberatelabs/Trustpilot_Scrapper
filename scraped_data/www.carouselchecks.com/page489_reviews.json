The only thing that kept me from giving you a five-star rating was the fact that you used my complete account number on your address label when returning the checks to me.  (You also used the same number in addressing this survey to me.)  I consider the use of that number to be a SECURITY issue and something that you should consider stopping IMMEDIATELY.  It made me very uncomfortable then and, even now, a month later.  There is no reason why you could not create an internal program to display only a PORTION of the account number  instead of the ENTIRE thing.  In this age where identity theft and hacking are major concerns, this practice worries me.",

        "text": "I ordered a set of checks July 3, 2020 and July 11, 2020 I was notified by email that they had shipped.\nJuly 22, 2020 I called Carousel checks and told them I had not yet received them. The very helpful girl said she would check with the shipping company and would get back with me the next day.\nShe got back with me the next day and said she had not yet heard from the shipping company and she would issue me new checks and have the order rushed. I expressed concern over the missing checks and she said she could issue the new ones with the next consecutive number after the missing checks. I should call my bank and tell them not to process any of the lost numbers. When I called the bank they told me there would be a $30 fee to stop payment. I hesitated to do this until I received the replacement checks. \nOn July 24 I did receive the \"lost\" checks by regular mail, but no explanation as to what had happened in the two weeks they were \"lost.\"\nOn July 25 I also received the new reordered checks by Fed X Ground.\nI am using both sets of checks as I feel they are mine by right for the hassle and worry I experienced when the original ones were lost. I should NOT incur an extra charge for an additional set of checks.\nDue to the sensitive nature of the products sold, I feel that Carousel should have kept better watch on the delivery process. I understand that this may not be economically possible to due to the sheer volume of products shipped, but I am concerned about customer and product safety. Thank you.",
