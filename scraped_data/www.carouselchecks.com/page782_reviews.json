My only issue is they charge extra for the boxes they come in!  Seriously?  Of course you're going to pay it - how else can you store your unused checks until you need them. I know this isn't any fault of Carousel Checks, but when I received the checks, one of the boxes was crushed and pretty much rendered useless. But, I bought it, so it's mine to trash!",
