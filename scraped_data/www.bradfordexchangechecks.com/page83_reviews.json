Your website took the longest time and me repeatedly trying to change my address. Once it finally showed my current address I placed my order. Only to find out through confirmation email that it was my old address that was being printed on 200 checks. Those checks would be sent to my old address. I have nothing to do with my old address. There is no forwarding I move too long ago. When I called to discuss to try and change the address so the checks could be sent to me at my current address. Your customer service person told me could not do that. I said then cancel the order and replace it with my current address. Again she told me could not be done. I then said do you understand these checks will go to an address I cannot get them from. She told me you're the one who placed the order there is nothing we can do about it we don't cancel orders. I said are you understanding I have no way to get the product. She told me when I order again I should call in the order. That way the address would have been changed. I told her I would not be placing another order. I would be notifying my bank of 200 checks being sent to an address I no longer lived at. The person I was speaking with had an attitude she outright told me there's nothing to do you're the one who placed the order. I said those checks have all my banking information on. She told me then you're going to have to stop payment on all 200 checks. Because there is no way you cancel orders and there is no way you can change my address. She said it was too late at already sent been sent to the printer. I told her I was going to notify the bank that honestly it showed my current address when I placed the order but then it was changed. I would be informing my bank that there is a payment coming out for a product I will never receive. The woman still was arguing with me. I asked them for a supervisor. She then informed me that she is a supervisor and there is nothing they can do. I said so then it's theft of money out of my account for a product I will never receive. She then told me as a one-time process she could refund my price. I told her what about the checks that are going to be mailed and she informed me there is absolutely nothing that can be done. she told me it was my fault because I should have called in to place the order because I didn't live at my previous address. Honestly there were other check companies I could have gone with and they allowed me to change my address and there was no problem. But I chose to keep the same type of check that I had ordered from you the first time. I will never order checks from your business again I will have nothing to do with your business. I will inform everybody I know not to do business with your company. I never received a tracking number so there's no way to know whether those checks were mailed. And if they were I have no clue where those checks are",

Every time I applied one, the price went up! Warning-I chose security at $2.75 per box at $5.50. When I went to check out, it automatically bumped my selection up to premium for $15.50! I had to change it back manually. Double and triple check your orders for fees/shipping choices. Be careful if you order on phone and use “autofill”, it may not display your info in the right boxes (my last name was entered twice). If they come when and as promised, I’ll likely order again. ",
