I swear that they try to make it so hard that you call in so that they can upsell you.\n-\nThe ' service and handling charge' was slightly higher than the cost for the checks itself, even with my discount code. But then there was lots of fanfare around the fact that they were going to not charge me for shipping.   How very magnanimous of them!\n-\nIt feels like a scam targeting older people who aren't tech savvy. It was irritating as \na young person but I got around it.  I'm \nmindful though that most people ordering/ using checks are older and less comfortable , with technology, by definition. \nIf you aren't text savvy, beware. I wouldn't want my parents or grandparents ordering this on their own they'd get ripped off. I would suggest you have a younger loved one, like your child, order it for you.",
