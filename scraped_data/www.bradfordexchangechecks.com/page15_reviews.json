I called all different hours of your service and always busy. i called when the lines just opened up and on hold waiting, called in the middle of the day, on hold and called at the end of the day and on hold. need more representatives answering calls. and more knowledgeable.

After another email saying if you don't respond that the order will be cancelled, I called again and was able to get someone 6 minutes later. As of today, 3 weeks after the call, the checks haven't come in but the charge for them has cleared the bank. In the past, the customer service and delivery has been much better and quicker.
