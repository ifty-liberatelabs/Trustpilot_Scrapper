I called the next day, within 24 hours and was told it was too late to cancel my order because they were already starting the printing process.  I received checks 2 weeks later.

        "text": "I am reviewing this without having received the shipping and handling refund I was told I would get if I joined the Bradford Exchange Rewards Program which popped up as an incentive to continue with the purchase. Without this incentive, I would have cancelled because the $20 plus would have more than tripled the $3.95 plus free standard shipping and free fourth pack price advertised in the flyer section of the local newspaper. Also, to get the shipping and handling rebate, I had to sign up for a membership which is automatically taken from my checking account. This membership of course, would have driven the price up even more.\n\nHaving explained that, I must add I received my order on time and in perfect condition. The printing and graphics are beautiful. And I can say, as to quantity, I received far more checks for the money than if I had ordered, as I usually do, through my bank.   When I called to check on the rebate, the woman who answered the phone was friendly and I was told it was being processed. When I called to cancel my membership the young lady who answered the phone wasn't thrilled that I was canceling, but she did agree to cancel without question.",
