They sent me a statement requesting payment and I called and once again they verified it had been cancelled. Today I received a package and they have charged my credit card from the online order that I cancelled. I can’t even use the checks they sent. I called them and was told “There is nothing we can do about it.” Dishonest people. Do not use them!!! Walmart is much cheaper",
