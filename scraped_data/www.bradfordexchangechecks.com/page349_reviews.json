The company, without contacting me first, decided it was a good idea to charge me for and \"supposedly\" send me something they knew I would have no use for! Then to make matters worse, I never got the checkbook cover. I called about it and, like so many other people, was told I couldn't get a refund without waiting longer for it to arrive. (this was several weeks after the order already) Then a few weeks later another charge showed up on my account for a subscription service that I never signed up for or was told about! I later found out this company is facing a class action law suit for scams like this and has BBB warnings on the BBB site for  deceptive practices!",
