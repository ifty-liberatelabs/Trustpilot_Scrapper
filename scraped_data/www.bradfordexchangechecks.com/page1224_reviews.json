I was transferred, placed on hold, and no one ever answered.\nThe issue has still not been resolved \n\nI checked the Bradford Exchange check ordering website.  It states that shipping is free. It doesn't mention having to join a subscription service, or other fees.  It just states buy one box get one free, \"free shipping,\" and that it costs less than ordering checks from a bank. This is not true. \n\nBradford Exchange failed to fully disclose the terms of its free shipping promotion, in clear, easy-to-understand language as required by federal and certain state laws, and falsely advertises prices less expensive than ordering from a traditional bank. Bradford Exchange violates these full-disclosure requirements and likely violates other consumer protection laws.",
