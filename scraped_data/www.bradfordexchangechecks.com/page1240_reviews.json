While ordering, I never got a chance to see what my information on the checks would look like, but for the price, it was fine.\nI got a receipt $18. Then the next day I got a message that the price had jumped to $39 without my permission because I was a \"previous customer.\"  No clue I was as I used to buy from Checks.com. I replied to the new receipt as soon as I saw it and said to cancel the order. I do not approve of the new charge.\n\nThey sent an email back 2 days later saying sorry, your order has already been processed.\n\nWhat a scam.",

When I asked them (including 2 supervisors), I was told repeatedly, that they changed printers and they could not ask the new printer to do the job correctly. When I asked them why they could not ask the printer to do a professional job, the answer was \"we can't ask them\"!! Since Bradford Exchange Checks now wants it's customers to accept unprofessional printing quality, the customers need to help them make the right decisions by not purchasing any checks, until they realize that the customers deserve to get professional results when they pay them for orders.\n\nThey responded with a \"I'm sorry, please email us so we can look into this\", but that was simply an attempt to make it look like they cared, to the public. There was absolutely no response at all, including from management which was what they were supposed to do. Three different supervisors all had the same \"we can't do anything to make our checks look professional because we selected a different printer, so our customers will simply have to be satisfied\"!",

Then, he insisted on charging me for \"phone orders.\" After telling him five times that their website was broken and I could NOT order online, he argued with me - a customer - and said I would have to pay the phone order charge. I demanded a supervisor. Here's the great part:  He refused. Flat out refused to let me talk to a supervisor UNTIL I gave him my card number. Seriously. And its all recorded (so they say) so they can pedal all the BS they want...worst customer service ever.",
