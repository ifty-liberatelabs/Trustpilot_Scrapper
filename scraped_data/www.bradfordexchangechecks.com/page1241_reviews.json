        "text": "My 83 year old mother has been inundated by catalogues from this company and as she struggles to get out made a purchase.  Having sent payment by cheque they continually chased her for payment insisting the cheque had not been received and increase the cost every time.  Eventually I settled by direct credit only to find out less than a week later they had banked the check.  This all happened in September, Its now December and after numerous unanswered phone calls and emails my widowed mother who lives on state and disability benefit is still £127 out of pocket.  Steer clear and warn elderly family members to do the same.\n\nI posted this review in 2016 and 5 years later Bradfordexchange respond sadly 2 years after my late mothers death and she never received the funds stolen from her by this company.  As an elderly lady on her on and surviving on benefits I will never forgive them",
