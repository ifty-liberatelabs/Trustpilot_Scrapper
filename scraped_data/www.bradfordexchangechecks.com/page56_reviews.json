They said to call back in about 2 hours to cancel, and when I did, they said order had already been printed and delivered to USPS for shipment, which logically seems impossible (since 8pm at night on a Friday).  I think they just didn't want to cancel my order, even though I would have ordered more again.  So they say they can't cancel it, and I am stuck with something that I didn't want, and when I tried to follow their instructions on how to cancel the order, they said they couldn't so it.  What a messed up system they must have, not sure I trust them to do anything right.  ",

I called back and the next person gave me an excellent explanation of the ordering prices and it I decided to place my order online and it went through without a problem.  The initial order was for buy one, get one for a total price of $4.84, her quote came back at over $60 and she couldn’t explain all the add-on costs and was not aware of the special that I said I saw.  I am not trying to complain about this person, but she should know that if she doesn’t know, she should go to a supervisor who would explain your special prices. I worked in the corporate world and don’t wish for this person to loose their job so that is not the objective of my comments but there should be easy to find information onsite, and as the second person explained your online order system is simpler and easier than ordering by phone. Please take my comments as helpful as that is my intention, and I want to add that you have a very nice selection of products and that I will return when it’s time to reorder. Thank you \n",

Almost a MONTH later, the checks arrived. The quality is thin paper that is poor quality. \nAdditionally, CHECK YOUR credit card because I was signed up for some members thing that I did NOT agree to and was told no refund would be issued for the first month since it had already been billed. \nThose checks that were supposed to be such a deal... not so much!
