        "text": "Long-time Bradford customer who has been ordering for many years - - -\nI received an e-mail promo from Bradford that offered $8.99/box pricing, as long as 2 or 4 boxes were ordered. When I attempted to order 2 boxes, the pricing on the order did not reflect the promo offered in the e-mail, but regular returning customer pricing. I called customer service. Rep with whom I spoke, told me price would be what was coming (not promo pricing). I asked if she could correct to the promo I rec'd from Bradford and was basically told she could not. I asked WHO correct the pricing to reflect the offered promo and was transferred to supervisor. This supervisor danced around my inquiry, telling me he could take care of my order but each time I asked about pricing, it was the non-promo regular pricing. I eventually disconnected as he was not willing to honor the promo. I then saw that Bradford also had a FB page so I msg'd there. I communicated with someone who IMMEDIATELY shared they COULD, in fact, honor the promo pricing and requested I send a copy of the outbound e-mail I rec'd from Bradford. I sent and rec'd reply that the pricing would now work. I attempted another order and pricing was still non-promo price. I again contacted FB customer service who told me to place the order at higher price and a credit would be issued when order processed. I placed order at the higher pricing as directed. The credit was eventually placed back onto my card used for the order. While this was resolved - it required quite a bit of effort on my part to get the promo pricing that was offered in the outbound e-mail promo that Bradford sent to me. Not the best customer experience.... ",
