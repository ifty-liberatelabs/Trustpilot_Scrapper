Now I will need to close my checking account and open a new one,  and notify all who have automatic payment on my account. New checks were supposedly printed, but they are worthless until the first checks are located. I fully understand that problems happen,  but your lack of response was terrible. I spent a total of 2 hours on hold, and when I finally made contact, she wasn't interested in listening to me, only offering me her script. The price is great, but I had to spend $40 in money orders, plus these new checks that are supposedly being printed is wasted money as I cannot use them. I won't be a future customer again, and advise others to think twice. Dr. Richard Hall",

There was no way to go back to review the order to see what was going to be printed on the check to make sure the typo was not on the order too. Called customer service several times and finally left my phone number because they were too busy to take my call. When I received the phone call back I was told I had to call back in 2 hours because they won't see the order until then. Basically I'm not sure if I need to cancel this order and place the order with a sales rep to get it right. I have to wait 2 hours to find out.",
