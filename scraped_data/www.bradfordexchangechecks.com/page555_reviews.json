Not sure what is going on and if my previous one was deleted or not posted so here it is again:\n\nI haven't even received the product and it has been three weeks now. I contacted you TWICE by email at your customer care email address about this and I haven't gotten any response. I called today and can't get through to anyone to check on the status of my order. What is going on??\n\nUpdate: Someone finally called me back and said they didn't print the checks because it is from an online bank and they don't process those, so they cancelled the order. Why did they not contact me about this to begin with instead of me waiting three weeks wondering when I will receive the checks? If they couldn't process the order, they should have notified me right away. I waited three weeks with no checks arriving (total waste of time!) and the only reason I found out what happened is because I reached out to them multiple times in order to finally get this lame response. If you look at their reviews, multiple people are complaining about the same thing, and also mention that the checks ARE printable and they confirmed it with their bank. This company has many bad 1 star reviews and their customer service is horrible. I will be ordering from American Bank Checks now. It's your loss. \n\nAnd PLAESE STOP putting the same canned response about “If you are in need of any assistance, please email us at customer_inquiry...\" with your order information” on ALL of your responses as you did below. I ALREADY DID THAT and got a worthless response. This review is INCLUSIVE of the response I got when I emailed your customer inquiry department.",
